Just FYI, I'm still going to have to parse "gpios" in my 
pinctrl-qdf2xxx.c driver, even though you're also parsing it here. 
That's because I need to make sure that the msm_pingroup array only 
contains "approve" addresses in its ctl_reg fields.

I do this because I need to make sure that "unapproved" physical 
addresses are never store anywhere in groups[].  That way, it's 
impossible for the driver to cause an XPU violation -- the worst that 
can happen is a null pointer dereference.
