I think I'm missing something and hope you can help to clarify here. It 
looks like the notion of v2, v3 should only be used if there's an indeed 
an revision update on the controller IP itself, correct?

In our case, if the same revision of GPIO controller is used but instead 
synthesized differently with different SoCs, then you are suggesting 
here that it should be dealt with SoC specific compatible string, correct?

For example, for the GPIO controller on NSP where drive strength is 
disabled, the compatible string in DT should look like this?

compatible = "brcm,iproc-gpio", "brcm,iproc-gpio-nsp";

For the GPIO controller on Stingray where pinconf is completely 
disabled, the compatible string in DT should look like:

compatible = "brcm,iproc-gpio", "brcm,iproc-gpio-stingray";

Is that correct?

Thanks,

Ray
