OK.

I was following the format of other mfd binding documents such as 
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/da9055.txt so I'll need your help 
understanding this.

I'm not familiar with the phrase Linuxisum. A Google search turns up 
several threads referencing Linuxisum but I can't seem to find the 
definition. One thread seems to imply that an existing driver such as 
GPIO is a Linuxisum and should not be re-defined. Am I understanding 
correctly?

OK. If I understand, this should be named after mfd then?

And this would be a gpio?

Thanks for your comments and for reviewing!
