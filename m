Hi Javier,
If you can provide the patch for moving MAX77802 to MAX77686 then I can 
create the other change to move the regmap and i2c dummy client for rtc 
of max77686 to rtc driver from core on top of your change. This will  
completely decouple the rtc driver from core and so will be easy to use 
for other chip MAX77620.

Thanks,
Laxman
