That is the main use case, yes. Velocity of platform
debugging/enabling is another one.

This is not completely true. The pinctrl drivers are exposing
functionality in terms of function groups (e.g., i2c1_grp, spi1_grp,
pwm1_grp, etc.) It is not enough, but it is a step in the right
direction for standard bindings and for tools that can build on top of
this.

This can be solved by tools that work with high level abstractions and
generate this specific information.

At some point we still need to poke registers. We already have a
drivers that do this (pinctrl) and a standard configuration interface
(the pinctrl device tree bindings). It seems natural to build on top
of this for those higher level concepts / tools.

Maybe. But we already expose pin control / muxing in
drivers/pinctrl/intel, yes, read-only at this point. Very useful for
debugging. Having write access would make debugging even more useful,
not to mention fast prototyping.
