How it handles this is... it doesn't.  Userspace does it.

There is *no* "firmware" on these devices.  The only thing you have is a
boot loader and a DT blob, and people will hate you if you tell them that
they have to change the DT blob and then reboot their systems to change
the functionality of a GPIO pin.

It's also entirely reasonable to assume that people are going to want to
change the configuration at runtime, given their diverse range of
applications.

Yes, that _could_ work, but I bet asking millions of people to change
what they're doing is going to be extremely difficult.  Remember the
golden rule of the kernel: thou shalt not break userspace.

So, there is _no_ possibility of removing this GPIO exposure to userspace
because we _know_ that it will break people.

If you think differently on the "thou shalt not break userspace" please
don't discuss it with me, I'm not interested.  Linus isn't interested
either, and if you try and discuss it with him, he'll tell you to get
out of kernel programming. :)

This is a commonly used API.  You can't change it.
