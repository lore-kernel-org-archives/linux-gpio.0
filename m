That is true sometimes. It is a tradeoff, I can also imagine actually
driving an I2C bus just to use the SCL line as a clock for something,
constantly feeding nonsense data through the I2C block and
ignoring SDA and reusing that pin as GPIO. (And a lot of other
theoretical usecases.)

Some pin controller hardware helpully only let you select groups
and makes such hacks impossible.

Also I guess the target audience of the SoC will affect the
hackishness of the usecases, and affect what they might attempt
to shoehorn into the design.

So model on whatever makes most sense, is usually how I think about
it. Or as the IETF says "rough consensus and running code".

I guess it is a bit of grayzone, and that is why both solutions coexist.

It might be true, there are so many variables to the equation that
I cannot tell.

Debuggability and readability of code and device trees and different
groups of people reading code vs device trees is another factor.

Scaringly, what is best for me as subsystem maintainer (that all
drivers look identical) is not always best for the users.
