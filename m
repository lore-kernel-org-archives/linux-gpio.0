Nice patch description.

(although a couple typos: s/wathdog/watchdog/, s/mfd/MFD/)

Why? If there's a GPIO sub-node, why wouldn't all the GPIO properties
appear there?

That's very much Linux-specific details. Re-phrasing it as follows would
make more sense:

==========
Each HW module within the PMIC is represented as a separate child node
within the PMIC's main node. These nodes are described below:

GPIO controller
-------------------

Required properties:
compatible: Must be "ams,as3722-gpio"
...

Regulator
-------------------

...
==========

That also has the benefit of fully describing the content of all the
child nodes in the binding, rather than only mentioning what the
compatible values should be, and saying nothing else about the nodes.

But, as Mark asked, why are any child nodes needed at all? If e.g. an
identical/re-usable GPIO HW block appears in many AMS PMICs, it possibly
makes sense, but otherwise it doesn't.
