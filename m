Adding Robert who reported the same thing.

This would break DT compatibility.

Sounds better, especially since this would reflect the hardware more
accurately. One DT node should translate into one GPIO chip. The
problem is that I'm afraid several other drivers are doing the same
thing and thus are now similarly broken.

The following is also likely to work as a workaround, but I would not
go as far as saying this should be taken as a fix. Hans, since you
wrote 7b8792b, could we have your input on this?
