All this only means one thing: this should be implemented as a
hierarchical domain, just like any other "random widget stacked on top
of the GIC". Digging into the internals of the GIC driver is not
acceptable anymore, and this patch is just horrible.

There is plenty of examples in the tree for you to look at and rewrite
that code using the abstractions that are already in place.

In the meantime, I am NAKing this patch. Please include the irqchip
maintainers in the next iteration of this series.

Thanks,
