Right, there is an overlap of the pinctrl "sleep" state with the ACPI power
management model. 

However, the main reason for implementing this is setting initial pin multiplexing
and configuration. This is normally done by BIOS, but there is currently no way of
changing the default configuration (except for a BIOS update). This is a problem
when using boards like MinnowBoard, where it is expected to get the board and
to be able to add various devices to its exported GPIO pins. We need a way to
change default pin multiplexing to enable the functionality required by a specific
device. In some cases we also need to set the bias to get things like interrupts working.

Another use case for pinctrl states is using custom reset pin configurations that need
to be controlled from the driver.

Since we have the pinctrl infrastructure and the all Intel ACPI pinctrl drivers already
support it, this seems the most straightforward way to implement it.

This is a problem with any modification we would make to the ACPI tables. 
It is true that pinctrl configuration could create conflicts when changing
pin multiplexing, but that could be avoided by using only the pinctrl states that
make sense for the entire ACPI configuration.

I agree this should be at least mentioned in the Documentation. I'll update it accordingly.
