thank you for bringing this up!
if anyone else (just like me) doesn't know about it, there are generic
bindings defined here: [0]

I just tested this on my X96 Max by defining the following properties
inside the PHY node:
  reset-delay-us = <10000>;
  reset-assert-us = <10000>;
  reset-deassert-us = <10000>;
  reset-gpios = <&gpio GPIOZ_15 (GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW | GPIO_OPEN_DRAIN)>;

that means I don't need any stmmac patches which seems nice.
instead I can submit a patch to mark the snps,reset-gpio properties in
the dt-bindings deprecated (and refer to the generic bindings instead)
what do you think?
