Patch applied. As you know I am already a big fan of this scheme.

What works for you works for me.

We could add dummy fixed clocks in the DTS files if
we wanted I suppose. The #interrupt-cells and interrupt-controller
things we can just fix, but I wonder what the maintainers of these
platforms are up to? Isn't Calxeda yours, and could Viresh fix
up the SPEAr?

Yours,
