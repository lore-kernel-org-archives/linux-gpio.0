What I would do myself is to put a syscon over this node.

syscon: syscon@10000080 {
    compatible = "broadcom,foo", "syscon";
    reg = <0x10000000 0x100>;
(...)

Or however that looks.

Then use the generic GPIO syscon driver on top of this,
see drivers/gpio/gpio-syscon.c

That driver does not support any pincontrol/muxing but
is a good candidate to handle the GPIO portions.

Syscons are there to handle these composite "misc sys
regs" devices.

You can even spawn subdevices to it by adding the
compatible-string "mfd-simple".

The rest of the subdevices would also have to be syscon
children.
