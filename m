This is needed due to some misdesign in the pinctrl core that's just,
sorry, braindamaged. The pinctrl core forces you to parse a device node
(which your driver perfectly understands) into a struct pinctrl_map.
This struct contains a struct pinctrl_map_mux which contains a group and
a function as strings. With the help of the driver struct pinctrl_map is
converted to struct pinctrl_setting which basically contains the same
information, but with a struct pinctrl_setting_mux which contains a
group and a function as integers. Instead of passing this data back to
the driver to act upon the structs are shred into pieces and passed to
the driver as individual variables.

So to recap the pinctrl core forces you to parse your data from the
device node into a format not native to the driver, then uses the
drivers help to convert this data in yet another format which it then
passes back to the driver in little pieces. Note that the pinctrl core
doesn't even use all this data except for requesting pins and for
generating debugfs entries.  These debugfs entries even often contain
useless information because neither struct pinctrl_map nor struct
pinctrl_setting are suitable for storing information for per-pin
controllers. Most drivers only put some information in there to find the
informations back the device node already contained.

A sane approach would just let the driver parse the data from a device
node into a cookie which is then passed back to the driver to be
activated. The driver would then be free to store whatever information
it needs in this cookie. The driver just request the necessary pins
itself from the pinctrl core instead of letting the core doing it.

I know this is not the answer you were looking for, but the pinctrl core
in my eyes is a big midlayer mistake and I'm not very fond of stretching
this concept further to be able to live with it for another round.
