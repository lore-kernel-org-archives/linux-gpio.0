If pin_request() is called with gpio_range not NULL, it means that the
requests comes from a GPIO chip and the pin controller handles this pin.
In this case, I would say the pin is connected between the pin
controller and the GPIO chip. Is my assumption right?

I am not sure it will fit all the cases:

- case 1: device A requests the pin (pinctrl-default state) and mux it
  as a GPIO. Later,it requests the pin as a GPIO (gpiolib). This 'weird'
  situation happens because some strict pin controllers were not declared
  as strict and/or pinconf is needed.

- case 2: device A requests the pin (pinctrl-default state). Device B
  requests the pin as a GPIO (gpiolib).

In case 1, pin_request must not return an error. In case 2, pin_request
must return an error even if the pin is connected between the pin
controller and the GPIO chip.
