Further, the main intended use for register patches is for registers
that the device manufacturer has no intention of documenting beyond
providing a list of register writes to be done on device startup.  The
common example is test registers with chicken bits that turn out to have
been needed, it's not realistic to expect that vendors are going to
start documenting their test registers.  It's normal to see these
applied only on early revisions of parts (eg, rev A needs a patch to
adjust things to match rev B which is the mass production version).

I'm not totally against dumping the data tables in some other directory
(we could do ../regmap/tables or whatever) but I fear it's going to
cause otherwise needless cross tree issues.
