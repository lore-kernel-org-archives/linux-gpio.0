Currently, EXTCON_CHG_USB_PD is not used on any extcon provider drivers.
I think that EXTCON_CHG_USB_PD is discoverable according to the H/W design
such as using ADC.

Also, The charger connectors of extcon are related to power_supply subsystem
because power_supply is in charge of behavior when the connector is attached/detached.
So, the extcon defines the EXTCON_CHG_USB_PD in order to detect this type.
