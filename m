v7:
    Remove the following clk related patches (Stephen Boyd has picked them)

    Incorporate Bjorn's comment in
	arm64: dts: Add ipq8074 SoC and HK01 board support

    Included Bjorn's and Rob's Ack for rest of the patches.

v6:
  * Include Rob's Ack to the first patch.

v5:
  * Removed the 'NA' binding from documentation

v4:

v3:
  * Addressed review feedback from Bjorn for pinctrl
     - Unified the names for qpic pads.
     - Corrected the names for pwm pins.
  * Updated pinctrl documentation.
  * Updated the default bootargs in ipq8074-hk01.dts.
  * Updated the gcc clocks driver for removing the
    unused halt_bit in few places.

v2:
  * Addressed review feedback from Stephen
    - Removed cpu-map entries
    - Added mmio-timer nodes
  * Fix sparse warnings in the gcc-ipq8074.c
