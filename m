Hi Stephen,

nice work!

But is that the right thing to do, given that we just took the
trouble to define a DT binding that is explicitly about
any GPIO, not just IRQ capable ones?

I am worries that the *irq* infix etc on these functions
will be a bit confusing.

Is it a lot of work to make it just generic and maybe bake it
into the gpio_chip so as to refuse already in
gpiod_request_commit() in gpiolib already?

Yours,
