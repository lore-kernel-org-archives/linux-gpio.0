Yes, I've noticed that these tests are wrong and I'm working on a patch for
it. It's another one of those cases where more lines needs patching to fix
it than the 3 lines this WM8998 patch adds, and also fixing it potentially
breaks the build because of dependencies that were accidentally working
because they never got compiled out. So I'd prefer not to half-fix it in
these WM8998 patches it's better to let the code settle and then fix it properly.
