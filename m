Right, the functions as-is won't show up as trace events, but they can
be easily modified to do so.

Right.

Right.

OK, let me try to run through an example:

1) Initially all pins (except for those set up by the firmware) are
configured as GPIOs.
2) The pinctrl driver probes.
3) Another driver, e.g. an I2C controller attempts to probe and
pinmux_enable_setting() is called.
4) The ->set_mux() op must set the proper function for the pin.
5) The ->set_mux() op must also disable the GPIO function for the pin.
To disable the GPIO function, the pinctrl driver must map the pin to a
GPIO bank/offset and disable the GPIO via the GPIO bank's GPIO_EN
register.

Now to map the pin back to a GPIO bank/offset, I had been using
pinctrl_find_gpio_range_from_pin(), which works just fine if the GPIO
driver has already probed.  But in the example above, we haven't
probed the GPIO driver yet so we're unable to do the mapping.  This
particular issue, I think, could by returning -EPROBE_DEFER from
->set_mux() if we're enable to look up the GPIO bank.

Each GPIO bank has a GPIO_EN register which enables the GPIO function
for the corresponding pin, overriding the function selected in the
pinctrl registers.  What I think we need here is pinctrl_free_gpio()
in the reverse direction: a way for the pinctrl driver to tell the
GPIO driver to disable the GPIO function for a particular pin.  Now we
could hack around this by having the pinctrl driver do the mapping
from pin to GPIO bank/offset and modifying the GPIO bank registers
itself, but that seems a bit ugly.

Thanks,
Andrew
