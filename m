This should ideally be split into its own patch but I don't care
much if the DT people are happy.

Nice.

Do you mean "default"

Apart from this the bindings and example look very good to
me, good job! I like it when people "just get it" with pin control
and that is where we need to be with this subsystem.

Isn't it even proper for MFD_MADERA to explicitly
select this driver. I see it hard how the chip would even
work without this. (Maybe it already does select it but then
default y is not necessary.)

Similar comment for the subdrivers.

Is it all in one file... despite all the Kconfig symbols... hm.
I guess we can create drivers/pinctrl/cirrus the day we need more
space.

So don't they have real names? Like the pin name on the underside of
the chip? That is what this naming convention is actually for.

If they are called "gpioN" in the datasheet I guess it is all right.
That is how e.g. the Qualcomm driver is done.

So this makes me feel maybe we should create drivers/pinctrl/cirrus
and split this driver into subdrivers per chip like others do.

The coding style document does say that ifdefs are ugly.

Would you consider splitting it up?

I don't think the pinctrl debugfs callback is compulsory.
It would be nice if this added some actual useful information
about the pin.

This will be possible to reuse from a GPIO driver as back-end, nice!

This too.

Overall it looks very nice.
