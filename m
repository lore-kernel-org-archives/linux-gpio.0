All in good time. 

But first @Bjorn and @Andy or @David can you please look and
review v4 "pinctrl: msm: fix gpio-hog related boot issues"
<https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10339129/>

Thanks.

Yes, I'm aware of that some of them where put to good use in the
Personal Telco Projec (501(c)(3) non-profit organization in Portland, Oregon):
<https://personaltelco.net/wiki/PersonalTelco>
And they have been somewhat vocal about it too:
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/ptp-general/RZ-VjKFonVo/cQgnGn2wAgAJ>
"The MR24 is a dual-band 802.11n 3x3 MIMO access point with a single 
ethernet port.  They are "last-gen" devices, and are starting to show up 
on ebay at reasonable prices as Meraki's deep-pocket cloud-management 
enterprise users are beginning to "upgrade" to 802.11ac gear.  Note that 
802.11n in this case means a fully-open-source driver (ath9k).  802.11ac 
drivers involve firmware blobs across the board.  You don't get 
super-wide 5GHz channels, but you get freedom. "

;)

By the way, it gets even weirder. In the past (and to this day) Meraki has
given away their current crop of enterprise APs via their
"Free AP for IT Professionals" <https://meraki.cisco.com/tc/freeap> program.
Of course, the main idea probably was to get them all "hooked/sold" on their
cloud-management firmware. Because of course that "Free AP" is intended to be
only good for the lifespan of included the 3-year license. However, 
"IT Professionals" do have their own mind and that's why there is some
continued interest in making alternative firmwares for these devices.
