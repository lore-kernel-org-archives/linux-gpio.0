Do you have an idea how we can destroy your doubts?
Either irq_chips nor irq_domains provide some sort of translation function 
for this.
Is there a driver in the kernel that has different gpio- vs. irq-namespaces 
where I can have a look at? How does platform code solve this translation? 
The irq_to_gpio functions in include/linux/gpio.h seem deprecated. They 
just return -EINVAL.
For me it seems, that there is no such device inside the kernel yet. 
Correct me if I'm wrong. If such a device comes to surface, we're in 
trouble. We will need some device-specific translation function then.
Is it the time to introduce an additional pointer for such a function now 
and nobody uses it? Or wait until such a device arises and introduce the 
pointer then?

At least the of irq mapping code make this assumption also: 
kernel/irq/irqdomain.c:483
It should be valid for us here too.
The additional assumption that I made is that if irq_domain == NULL (not 
only xlate), that we can use intspec[0] either.

No it has to be in both branches as it is. Device tree data is big endian. 
The conversion is converting big endian data (from device tree in both 
cases) to cpu endianess and not coverting TO big endian.
My test machine is a arm in little endian mode and it provided wrong values 
if I did not do the conversion.
What I am a bit unsure about is if the xlate function is expecting the 
intspec pointer to point to big endian device tree data or data already 
converted to cpu endianess. For the standard xlate functions 
irq_domain_xlate_[one|two|onetwo]cell it does not matter.
