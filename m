This patch set adds a pinctrl driver for NXP LPC18xx/43xx devices.

The pinctrl driver uses the generic muxing and properties DT bindings as
described in pinctrl-bindings.txt. There is still two TODOs left in the
pinctrl driver regarding property control of special usb1 pins but I would
like it merged regardless of this. Support will be added once I get USB up
and running on the MCU.

Checkpatch complains a lot about the driver but that's what you get when
you embedd a large function/pin spec table from the data sheet I guess.

Changes since v1:
 - minor white space fixes
 - split pinctrl/gpio patch set
 - rebase on v4.1-rc1

Since there were no comments on v1. I hope that these drivers can
make it to Linux 4.1.

There are no dependencies in this patch set. The DTS changes will
be sent separately to arm-soc once this patch set goes upstream.

Base support for the NXP LPC18xx family can be found here:
