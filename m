This is perfectly possible, just don't use
gpiochip_set_chained_irqchip() which has this semantic
effect.

Use irq_set_chained_handler() and irq_set_handler_data()
directly instead.

I do see that this is maybe easier for the handler to get the bank
passed in.

However when I in the RFT patches change the driver to allocate
and pass a struct for the gpio chip, it all looks a bit different.
You would have to get the sgpio from the bank instead, which
may require to introduce a special pointer for that.

What we want to get rid of is this:

for (i = 0; i < SIRFSOC_GPIO_BANK_SIZE; i++) {
                bank = &sgpio->sgpio_bank[i];
                if (bank->parent_irq == irq)
                        break;
}
BUG_ON (i == SIRFSOC_GPIO_BANK_SIZE);

So what about passing something like that to the handler:

struct sirf_irq_handler_data {
    struct sirfsoc_gpio_chip *sgpio;
    struct sirfsoc_gpio_bank *bank;
};

Then the irq handler instantly have pointers to all it needs.
But maybe it's better to just pass the bank, whatdoIknow.
