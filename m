I feel that taking this argument to its logical conclusion leads to
never exporting any GPIOs to userspace and doing everything in the
kernel. If userspace has exported the GPIO and is managing its state,
then it can *already* cause very weird hardware behaviour if set wrong.
The fact that userspace is controlling the GPIO state and not the
kernel already says that the kernel doesn't know how to manage it, so
why not expose the option for userspace to set the persistence, given
that it should know what it's doing?

Cheers,

Andrew
