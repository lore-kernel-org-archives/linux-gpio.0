No, you don't need to use regulator-compatible - that's deprecated.
Just use the node names.

I'm not sure what there is to add...  if the regulator is only
instantiated when it features in the device tree then obviously it must
be included in the device to be instantiated.

Only getting probed for device is in DT is exactly the problem here, and
nothing prevents us having separate modules for things without
enumerating everything in DT.

Putting everything in DT means more work for people integrating the
device and means that we have to have a full and complete understanding
of the device at the time we write the DT, including decions about how
we split the functionality of the device between subsystems.

That's not a new driver, it's from more than a year ago (before or about
the same time the helpers got added IIRC).
