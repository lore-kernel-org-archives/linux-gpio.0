There may be room for improvement here.

Here is my recollection of how I choose the names:

"root" is the thing embedded in the struct irq_desc, if you think about 
a typical linked list structure like this, we can refer to the starting 
point as the "root".  Sometimes it might be referred to as the "head" of 
the list, but usually not the "tail"

"child" was used to indicate the thing we get to by traversing the link 
in the list.  The fact that ->parent is the name of the next pointer and 
that it points to something called "child" is confusing here.

So what do I think should be done?  This:

Either
   A) s/child_irq_data/parent_irq_data/g  As this patch does, but leave 
the root_irq_data name unchanged.

   B) Change the name of the ->parent in struct irq_data to ->next

But that is just my $0.02

I fear we risk a Bike Shedding type of discussion here.
