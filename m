Yup, the check was there from the very beginning. Think of
OF_GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW flag (it is widely used in drivers.)

The documentation in Feng's driver says "second cell is used to specify
optional parameters (unused)," which is not entirely correct. With the
standard xlate call it is used for active-low flag. You can implement
active-low flag w/o using the second cell, but it will be ugly.

Thanks,

Anton
