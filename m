The reason is to forward a gpio reference to a real h/w gpio device
while not having to expose said real gpio device details.=20

It doesn=E2=80=99t parse the binding; the xlate method of a driver does=

Looking into a list of 54 capes for the beaglebone I can only find a si=
ngle
one that uses an interrupt instead of a gpio, and that can easily be co=
nverted
to using the gpio.

The IRQ forwarding case is easier than the GPIO one TBH. The IRQ parsin=
g core
can handle complex cases so adding a new one won=E2=80=99t be a big dea=
l.=20
