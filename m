Unless we encode the needed registers/info into the DT, that info
could be considered a device description if you consider each regulator
to be a separate device burned onto the same silicon, much like we
do with the different IPs on SOCs. It would be nice to have 100% generic
regulator drivers, but the DT maintainers might not go for that :)

Agree, unless we go with my above idea! :)

Yeah, I saw that after I posted this, my new version just puts a pointer
to the right regulator_desc struct in the of_device_id.data, then we can
use it directly with no middle man steps, much cleaner.

Right, but only if you supply .of_match in your regulator_desc, and even then it
only matches on node name, not "compatible" string, if it did I could use it to
eliminate my call to of_get_regulator_init_data, the whole probe function would
become about 10 lines of code :)

Thanks, I was looking for good examples, that and rt5033 seem to be the requested
style for new regulator drivers.
