Looks like we're stuck with individually named functions for these
then...

This makes me wonder what wifi1_uart (and uart1) actually is...

The wifi\d_uart seems to have 5 pins in its group and wifi\d_uart\d
seems to be two sets of two pins. So perhaps this is some alternative
routing and wifi0_uart0 and wifi0_uart1 is actually the same function?

@Ram, can you help us out here?

Sounds good!
