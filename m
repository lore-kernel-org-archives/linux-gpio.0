This is one small chunk of work related to DT overlays for expansion
boards. It would be good to have a way to expose #<list>-cells types of
providers through a connector in a standard way. So we introduce a way
to make "nexus" nodes for these types of properties to remap the consumer
number space to the other side of the connector's number space. It's
basically a copy of the interrupt nexus implementation, but without
the address space matching design and interrupt-parent walking.

The first patch implements a generic method to do this, and the second patch
adds a unit test for it. The third patch is more of an example than anything
else. It shows how we would modify frameworks to use the new API.

Stephen Boyd (3):
  of: Support parsing phandle argument lists through a nexus node
  of: unittest: Add phandle remapping test
  gpio: Support gpio nexus dt bindings
