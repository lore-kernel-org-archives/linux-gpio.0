We already have 95% of this.  We can already specify individual pin 
ranges, and the vast majority of the code recognizes the ranges.  There 
is only one small loophole, and that's in gpiochip_add_data().  The 
for-loop iterates over all GPIOs:

	for (i = 0; i < chip->ngpio; i++) {
		struct gpio_desc *desc = &gdev->descs[i];

		desc->gdev = gdev;
		/*
		 * REVISIT: most hardware initializes GPIOs as inputs
		 * (often with pullups enabled) so power usage is
		 * minimized. Linux code should set the gpio direction
		 * first thing; but until it does, and in case
		 * chip->get_direction is not set, we may expose the
		 * wrong direction in sysfs.
		 */

I believe the real problem is that this for-loop should be moved from 
gpiochip_add_data() into some other function that is called *after* the 
pin ranges are defined.  We can put it in gpiochip_add_pin_range(), maybe.

My patch covers the loophole by adding a check inside get_direction(). 
If we fix gpiochip_add_data(), I can remove that patch.

However, I think that change is risky and will require a lot of testing 
and review.
