I don't really mean you should select the "sleep" state.

I meant, as part of setting the "default" state or even the "init"
state, we would inspect the "sleep" state, use those settings, and
program them into the registers at this early point.

Then never touch the registers again, and never really go to the
sleep state by software, just by hardware.
