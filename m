For all the GPIO patches:
Acked-by: Linus Walleij <linus.walleij@linaro.org>

With the smallish changes needed to patch 5/33 that one is acked too.

In fact I would ACK it anyway, because the net total cleanup is so
nice on the kernel at large... SA11x0 has never been prettier than
after this series.

I suspect you want to keep the series together and queue it in the ARM
tree? Else tell me what to apply in the GPIO tree.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
