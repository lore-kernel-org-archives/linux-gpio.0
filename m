I thought the whole idea (or at least a large part of) the new
user-space interface was to allow lookups by line names precisely in
order not to have to rely on gpio numbers, which may not only change
between boots, but also between hardware revisions, etc.

What's wrong with naming the pins in DT and use that for lookups?

I've been too busy with other stuff this spring to follow the new
user-space interface development, but I assume that this had been taken
into account in the design?

Thanks,
Johan
