I don't think it's worth making patches that change things around when 
they're immediately going to be thrown away. It is needless churn. If 
you take the approach of removing settings that shouldn't be applied, 
you'll vastly reduce (and possibly even completely eliminate) the work 
to more optimally represent what's left.
