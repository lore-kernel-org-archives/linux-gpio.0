Thanks a lot! I will follow up with the cleanup patches.

Sure, will do.

Makes sense! Will add ARCH_BITMAIN default to this Kconfig.

I don't know the reasoning behind it. This SoC is targeted at AI/ML
usecase, and there are 4 PWM modules in it. Maybe they tried to integrate
motor control usecase with these PWM modules? There is also a RISC-V core
in this SoC, which can perform some real time offloading.

It will work, but I want this driver to be probed very soon.

GPIO support is handled by Designware IP. I have already added DTS
support for it. And you acked those 2 patches ;-)

For pinconfig, sadly there is nothing I can see in the vendor kernel so
assumed that the SoC doesn't support it (yes it is wierd). I will ask
Bitmain folks to be sure.
