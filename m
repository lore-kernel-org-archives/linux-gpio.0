I took at closer look at this patch now and I really don't think it
should be merged at all.

We have a mechanism for handling wake-up sources (documented in
Documentation/power/devices.txt) as well as an ABI to enable/disable
them using the power/wakeup device attribute from userspace.

Implementing proper wakeup support for unclaimed GPIOs would take some
work (if at all desired), but that is not a reason to be adding custom
implementations that violates the kernel's power policies and new ABIs
that would need to be maintained forever.

[ And we really shouldn't be adding anything to the broken gpio sysfs
interface until it's been redesigned. ]

Meanwhile you can (should) use gpio-keys if you need to wake your system
on gpio events.

That's expected. We generally don't want attributes to appear or
disappear after the device has been registered (although there is a
mechanism for cases were it makes sense). This is no different from
how your v3 patch worked either.
