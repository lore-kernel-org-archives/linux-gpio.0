Whether or not a kernel driver exists can vary by kernel version. The
dtb needs to work either way. The way you have done it would require
dtb changes.

It would be useful to describe the function of gpios in a way that
either subsystems can bind to them (e.g. leds, rf-kill, keys, etc.) or
that information can be exported to userspace.

Isn't there some plan/desire to fix the GPIO sysfs interface?
