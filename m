Mostly happy with this.

Also add an entry for the device tree bindings please.

I do not understand what some of these things are doing in the
device tree header file.

It just looks creepingly similar to some of the magic I've seen
in board files.

It makes much more sense that the device trees either:

- Use the interrupts as a flat array 0...N across all banks

- Model each bank as a separate GPIO chip

This is somewhere inbetween, you are modeling it as a single
gpiochip but still not, becuase the device tree author still need
to address banking, that is confusing.
