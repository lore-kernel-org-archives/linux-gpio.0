Any subnodes are implicitly taken as hog definitions. This is not right=
 because
gpio controllers might have subnodes that they use for another purpose.

If it=E2=80=99s not possible to remove a hog, then it=E2=80=99s no good=
 for my use case in which
the gpios get exported and then removed.

There won=E2=80=99t be a single board dts file if you=E2=80=99re using =
things like overlays.
