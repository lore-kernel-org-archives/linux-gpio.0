Yeah, but that quickly gives away as there are many singleton devices
and everyone tries to add theirs at the end of the list resulting in
merge conflicts.

Agree with Kevin that it would be churn. If done, it should be last
thing that gets done in a merge window. I would not attempt it in
relatively busy merge windows like this one.
