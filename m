Could you point me to a gpio driver that works like that already? Would be 
easier to learn that from an example. That infrastructure with all its different 
modes is seriously complex and not very well documented.

Without that patch, you are forced to poll for event changes in your 
application, timer-driven. There are application that cannot process these GPIOs 
because they lack such logic (mraa with node-red-node-intel-gpio is a public 
example).
