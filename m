Hmm but isn't it the pinctrl provider device losing context here?
I think the restore of the pin state should somehow happen automatically
by the pinctrl provider driver without a need for the pinctrl consumer
drivers to do anything.

Or what's the use case for pinctrl consumer driver wanting to store
a pin?
