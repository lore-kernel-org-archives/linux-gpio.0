Great news.  I've been thinking about digging out my h3600, but it's
very old, and hasn't been turned on for many years.  I'm not sure what
state it's in.

I've been hoping to try booting some kernels with qemu-system-arm, but
so far I've completely failed to get qemu-system-arm to do anything
useful - it just sits there doing apparently nothing, irrespective of
which platform I choose or which kernel I give it.

Not so great news - that's -ENOENT.  Did that happen before these
changes?  That could be that the gpiod lookup table isn't found.
However, if that were the case, I'd have expected an error message
along the lines of:

Failed to get GPIO for xxx: -nnn

from soc_pcmcia_request_gpiods().  The other possibility is that
we're not getting to sa11x0_drv_pcmcia_legacy_probe() but instead
trying to initialise it as a generic sa11x0 socket, and
sa11x0_pcmcia_hw_init() is failing as a result.

We should be using the legacy probe on H3600, so sa11x0_pcmcia_hw_init()
should never be reached.

Well, the H3600 PCMCIA driver raises lots of "that can't be right"
questions for me, so I decided to leave most of the GPIO stuff alone
there, and just convert only the bits which made sense to me - the
detect and ready(irq) bits.
