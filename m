Hello,

This short series enables GPIO state persistence across controller resets,
modifying gpiolib to expose control of the behaviour and providing an initial
implementation in the Aspeed GPIO controller.

This is a follow-up to the initial RFC series[1], which had some undesirable
features (and bugs).

>From the RFC, I've:

1. Dropped the idea of distinguishing between sleep and reset cases[2]
2. Changed the default behaviour from transitory to persistent (must explicitly
   request transitory behaviour for controllers supporting reset tolerance)[3]
3. Dropped the ability for userspace to configure whether or not the exported
   GPIO is persistent[4][5]

On point 2, whilst the patch modifying the sysfs interface ABI no-longer lives,
gpiolib-sysfs still requires modification to provide consistent behaviour with
the chardev interface in providing a default-persistent GPIO on export.

Regarding point 3, I figured this is something we can add later once there's
been some discussion on how much of a good idea it is.

As some of the capabilities in the RFC have been dropped, I've squashed the
gpiolib support into a single patch as it's not really that complex.

Hopefully that addresses the feedback on the RFC. Please review!

Andrew
