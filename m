The GPIO standby doesn't support interrupt controller itself, it only
wires the GPIO line to the external IRQ of GIC. So it is not similar
to other driver. Each GPIO is fixed to GIC IRQ index, and never
change.

Is that possible if we change to this approach:
- Keep all GPIO as GPIO mode by default.
- If anyone want to use them as interrupt, they must add the interrupt
node to DT specific-board below:

Example to configure GPIO_DS11, 12, 13 as external irq:

&sbgpio {
        interrupts = <0x0 0x2b 0x1>,         /* GPIO_DS11 */
                        <0x0 0x2c 0x1>,         /* GPIO_DS12 */
                        <0x0 0x2d 0x1>;         /* GPIO_DS13 */
