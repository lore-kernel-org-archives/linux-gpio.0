It's intended to handle the case when several GPIOs can be
switched at the same time by a single register write. It implies
being on the same controller.

You're comparing pears and apples now I think.

A userspace ABI making it possible to switch several GPIOs
on several controllers is perfectly doable both with and without
the above interface.

In this latter case you're more worried about the latency
incurred by the userspace/kernelspace switch, whereas
the former is about the delays incurred by several register
writes.

Userspace/kernelspace switch delay is a few magnitudes
larger than the delay between sequenced register writes I
suspect.

Agree. I have a problem with it too.

I like the character interface idea actually.

/dev/gpiochip0
/dev/gpiochip1
(...)

Then ioctl() operations to do all the magic to figure out what GPIOs
are there and how to read/write them etc. To me this reflects the
system properly and gives all kind of freedom to manipulate the
GPIOs with efficient context switches. Plus we can deliberately
avoid including any GPIO numbers anywhere, just allow names
and nothing else.

But I'm no userspace/kernelspace expert, let's hear what
the linux-api mailing list has to say.
