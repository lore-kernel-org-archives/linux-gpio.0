Try to linebreak the commit message at column 70 or so.

(I'll fix up the spellings etc, so don't worry too much about this.)

s/gpio/a GPIO line (I prefer upper-case and clear specification of what
GPIO is. Why do you say it is automatic? How else would it be done
if not by automation?

It seems other subsystems are using "linux," as prefix so change
this to "linux,gpio-export"

I don't quite understand this sentence. Do you mean:

"each child node of the compatible node represents  a GPIO line
 or, if it does not have a name specified, a list if GPIOs to export"

I don't think this works, the nodes get messy if some of
them specify a single GPIO line and set it as output or input,
and some specify an array.

You have to make your mind up here: either we export
exactly *one* GPIO line per node, or all nodes can export
an array and also pass in arrays of output values and so
on.

One node per GPIO is arguably easiest and most readable,
so please rewrite the patch in accordance.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
