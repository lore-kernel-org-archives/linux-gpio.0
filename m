These are generic gpio flags that can be used with a multitude of
devices (e.g. regulators, reset-signals for all sorts of ICs, etc.), and
whether there are any in-kernel users (dts) should probably not carry
much weight.

Some people are still stuck with 4.4 or 4.9 and it may still be a while
before they update to, say, the next LTS kernel (4.13) and get bitten by
this.

Thanks,
