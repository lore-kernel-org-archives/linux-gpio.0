Still feels to me like it should be the providers job to the
restore the state rather than expecting the consumer to
re-request any state it had. But lets wait and see what Linus
thinks.

Also not sure if you have seen this chain, but probably worth a
look:

https://www.spinics.net/lists/devicetree/msg200649.html

It is adding support to the GPIO code for controllers that can
have options to retain state across reset, not the same but
probably at least slightly related to this series.

Thanks,
Charles
