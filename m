The speed thing sounds like someone needs to work on the tooling for
working on firmware TBH.

Simply stating that there are in future going to be some higher level
things which make use of this firmware interface isn't altogether
reassuring when we're still in the process of solving the issues for the
DT version of this...

Both DT and ACPI have a system model behind them and they're not the
stame system model.  Importing one into the other directly without
carefully thinking through how they play nicely with each other seems
likely to lead to problems further down the line, you might know exactly
how you intend this to work but how do we make sure that a firmware
author in some system integrator knows about this and is able to safely
write firmware in a few years?
