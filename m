Yes, it is debugging and capturing all the info at single place. 
Currently, gpio debugFs shows the gpio related stuff and the pinctrl on 
pinconfig but there is not any dump which shows the complete pin mapping.
The effort is to compile all the data in single place with proper 
message to avoid any manual work for decoding multiple outputs.

This callback can print the stuff for GPIO related stuff as there is not 
much info about the pinmux related configuration to gpio driver. For 
GPIO or functional mode, it can only display gpio or functional mode.

Is there something we can link from gpio driver to pinctrl driver like 
pinctrl_debug_show()?
Like in gpio_request(), we say that pinctrl_request(), similary on the 
GPIO dbg_show(), we can say pinctrl_dbg_show() and get all the info for 
prints.
This will also serve the purpose.
