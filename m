I think so too, I looked around and found that the nvidia pinctrl was
doing something similar with of_find_property():
<https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.17-rc2/source/drivers/pinctrl/tegra/pinctrl-tegra.c#L652>
|	has_prop = of_find_property(np, "gpio-ranges", NULL);

However this looks kinda funny, since "has_prob" is declared as a bool
and of_find_property() returns a pointer to a "struct property"....
Tell you what: If nobody beats me to it, I'll sent a patch for this after
the pinctrl-msm's gpio-hog has been dealt with. :)

I think I can add something to this thought as well. Albeit, it's a
more traditional, less zany story.

I started with the apm821xx (a PowerPC 464 derivative SoC) back
in 2015-2016 because of the wide availabilty of cheap (as low as $5 ~ $10)
secondhand enterprise accesspoints like the Cisco Meraki MR24
<https://openwrt.org/toh/meraki/mr24>. 

What happen was that cooperations ditched all the outdated 802.11n
devices and upgraded to the shiny new wave1 802.11ac gear. Now, the
old 802.11n devices still worked perfectly fine but the firmware on
the device requires the user to have a valid subscription to a 
"Meraki Cloud License".

And as you can probably guess: The License is sold as a yearly subscription
starting from $150 for a single device. So, these devices became practically
e-waste since nobody in their right mind would buy a used device and then
fork over the ~$150 fee per annum.

The MR24 craze is mostly over by now. You can still find a few. However
some listings are now selling them with OpenWrt/LEDE for ~$40.

And obviously, this cycle will continue on, but now with the old wave1
802.11ac gear that gets replaced. In fact this business has spawned
companies that are actively working on supporting "old" enterprise gear
via their own OpenWrt/LEDE derivatives.

I see you skipped v3 and replied to v4.
