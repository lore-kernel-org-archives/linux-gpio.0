It is a bit different with pinctrl-at91, we don't have npins groups.
Even if there is no hardware reality behind we have groups of pins.

We can use the generic pinconf for sure. My main concern were the
concepts of groups and functions. But it seems, now, we can't get rid o=
f these
concepts.

I am trying to figure out what we loose (or not) if using a mapping suc=
h as
'a pin =3D a group'. For example I am thinking about sysfs, it is proba=
bly
more human readable to have some groups with a name related to the
device they are connected as done in pinctrl-at91.
