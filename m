thank you!

I think it would be nice to have GPIO interrupt support and I can
certainly help testing this. however, I am neither a pinctrl nor an
interrupt expert. I can have a look at the patches and give (limited)
feedback, but these should certainly be reviewed by people with more
knowledge of these (pinctrl and irq) subsystems.

Jerome has already spent (probably quite some...) time with the Meson
GPIO interrupt support, he has already replied to patch #1.

apart from that: thanks to anybody who dedicates time to this topic -
this is probably one of the most exotic bits (and thus hard to
implement) in the Meson SoCs!

Martin
