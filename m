Good point. Will do.

The .get_function_groups callback in pinmux_ops expect a char array pointer in 
*groups. That is currently implemented as

	*groups = pmap->pin_names;
	*num_groups = PINS_COUNT;

How can I implement that without a persistent char pointers array, where all I 
have is the .name fields scattered in a big pinctrl_pin_desc array?

OK.

I had to have the char pointers array anyway, as explained above. If you have 
a better suggestion to that problem I will happily implement it as you suggest 
here.

Thanks for reviewing, and for applying all my other little documentation 
update patches.
