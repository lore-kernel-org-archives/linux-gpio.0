On this case, we have already property "line-name" and passed the name 
of the gpio via this property.
The property names is "line-name" which is good for one string. We can 
support other property "line-names" with multiple string per GPIO index.

line-names = "wlan-reset", "wlan-enable";

I have 5th patch for this and will rearrange series as you suggested on 
5th patch.
