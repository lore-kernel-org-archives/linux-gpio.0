To me as subsystem maintainer any "necessarily different" bindings
are just a big confusion for the head.

Since you're adding a new driver, try to stick to the generic bindings
even if it deviates from what you are used to for Renesas, because
even if it may be more work for you guys or make you annoyed that
now a certain Renesas is different from all other Renesas platforms,
for the community this makes things easier to maintain because
we can look at the driver and its bindings and say "ah I know this".

The fact that historically all the early adopters of pinctrl in device tree
have these funky custom bindings is unfortunate but just something
that we need to live with.
