I agree.

Then what happens when someone wants to selectively disable gpio hogs?

status = "okay", "disabled", "okay";

While I often push things to fewer nodes and more compact descriptions, 
I don't think that is the right direction in this case.

label is standard. labels you just made up.

The point is the more one off changes I see that are all inter-related, 
the less willing I am to accept any that don't consider all the cases. 
The inter-relationship here is how do we describe gpio lines that don't 
otherwise have a connection to another node and how to deal with them if 
that changes.
