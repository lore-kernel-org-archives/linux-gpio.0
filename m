V4 depends on 5 patches that got negative feedback in irqdomain subsystem.
One more problem for this approach is to virtual IRQs are statically
allocated during the driver probe.
This looks a step backward to me.
Recently, gpio_irqchip migrated to on-the-fly allocation in case some
controllers may have lots of
GPIO lines.


Finally, I came up with another (I think, better) solution.
I think v5 is less controversial,
and works very well in on-the-fly manner.

I am sending it shortly...
