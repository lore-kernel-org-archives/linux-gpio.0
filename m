I think we're ready to apply this to the GPIO and pinctrl trees.
Could you:

- Rebase on top of v4.9-rc1 (fails to apply for me)
- Add the collected ACKs
- See if Andrey can provide an additional Test tag
- Resend

Also please look at Andreys patches to see if there is some good
inspiration for further cleanups.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
