Wonderful that you get hw available to be closer to issues.
Maybe it would be worth to give you some guidance what to do with PL and
how to add more stuff there especially in connection to GPIO.
We have pinctrl driver in vendor tree but my colleague needs to upstream
firmware interface first.

I am happy to discuss this to find out a way how this can be handled.
There are several things together.

On arm64 how to disable/enable access for NS software.

Maybe also separate pins PS pins from PL pins. Right now all are
together and not sure if this is ideal in sense of DT overal for
example. Separate nodes would enable better flexibility. Also if you
look at partial reconfiguration you can just route just part of pins
which suggest list of gpios used there.

Thanks,
Michal
