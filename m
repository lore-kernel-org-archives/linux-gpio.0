Hi Linus,

It does not add a per-bank parent IRQ. The meson gpio irq is an IP independent
of the gpio/pinctrl subsystem. In a nutshell, we have 8 interrupts on the GIC
and we can route the signal of almost any pin of any bank to these parent irqs.
The fact that there 1 gpio-irq controller and several gpio controller make the
design a bit tricky

We already talked about this IP, here is the discussion :https://patchwork.ozlab
s.org/patch/684208/

At the time, the problem was that I was creating the mapping within the
gpio_to_irq callback, which is wrong.

irq_first, irq_last were introduced because there is no way to have direct
mapping between the gpio number and the hw interrupt number. (details are in our
previous discussion). If a more generic solution can be used for this, it would
be nice :)

While I think having a irqdomain in the gpio driver and using the
request_resources callback to create the mapping in the underlying domain might
be a solution to ressouce allocation problem we had, I think the meson-gpio-irq
should be implemented has an independent driver because  it is an independent
device. Eventually, this device should be the parent irq controller of the gpio
controller.

I not sure that there is a reason for using syscon here, or if it is a good idea
to have the data of this controller as globals for the gpio driver ...
