Right, will add.

Also I would hold off on taking the GPIO bindings just yet. Mark Brown
has stated he would like the compatible string removed from the regulator
sub-node before he takes the regulator components, so for consistency sake
I am also removing the string from GPIO as well. With this, it is difficult
to have the sub-node still be a GPIO controller.

( gpiochip->of_node vs gpiochip->dev->of_node gpiolib.c:694 etc.. )

So the main pmic node will also be the GPIO controller node.

pmic: tps65912@2d {
	compatible = "ti,tps65912";
	reg = <0x2d>;

	interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
	interrupts = <28 8>;

	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <2>;

	gpio-controller;
	#gpio-cells = <2>;
};
