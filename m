Correct, address translation code is needed here...

Only one reason -- backward compatibility in sense of referencing a GPIO
line on client's side. This API design is broken, I agree.

Honestly I would prefer to get rid of this "feature", new code allows to
reference on client's side either a parent GPIO controller device node,
or bank nodes, probably the improvement can be done in a few steps?

  - this change,
  - convert clients to reference a GPIO bank directly,
  - remove root GPIO controller (e.g. make it "simple-bus") and convert
GPIO banks to "gpio-controller"s.

Can an evolution like this happen?

Please see the comment above, the proposed change does not modify this
legacy part.

Yes, it is. Thousand thanks to hardware designers.
