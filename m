for the benefits of introducing macro 'FUNCTION_EX', it will end with
 .name = "uart_ao_b", -> same for both EE, AO domain, and it will match
the DT part (although still different for '.groups')

I'd rather *NOT* to push a pinctrl patch for just changing
'uart_ao_b_gpioz' to 'uart_ao_b_z' (it's a cosmetic change, and still
end with two different name - 'uart_ao_b_gpioz/z' & 'uart_ao_b' in DT)
