Hi Linus & Laurent,

Thanks for taking the time to think about this.

I'm working on the non-upstreamed r8a7373. The closest relative in the PFC area is the r8a73a4, so pfc-r8a7373 is primarily modelled on that, and I'm trying to devise extensions that could be upstreamed in the form of r8a73a4 patches, even if we don't get the r8a7373 itself upstreamed. I do have access to an APE6EVM for testing that if necessary, but I'm not currently working on it.

Yeah, I'll CC them in from now on. My questions seemed more generic, but obviously there are per-platform design choices to be made here.

That's exactly my concern. We've got a large mass of code that aggressively uses the legacy APIs, together with some local extensions, and as such we need to get pinctrl/pinconf to cover all of that. And preferably more elegantly. :)

Correct. The mux is only switching IE+OE+DATA, not PU+PD.

Yes, we do have automatic switch to the GPIO mux when someone uses the GPIO API, thanks to gpio_request_enable. Thus there is no need for gpio-mode for the GPIO API. But I think it may still needed for elegant sleep/idle handling.

I refer you to pinctrl.txt. What I'm trying to avoid here is the "GPIO mode pitfall", where we can /only/ usefully manipulate the lines through the Linux gpio API.

I want to be able to drive a function line low in sleep mode, without having to write code that uses the gpio_ API. I want to be able to express that as PIN_CONFIG_OUTPUT 0.

Where we currently stand locally is that we have a load of code that use the legacy function GPIOs thus:

resume:
    gpio_request(GPIO_FN_XXX)  // Set function mux on GPIO36 pin
suspend:
    gpio_request(GPIO_PORT36)  // Set GPIO mux on pin
    gpio_direction_output(GPIO_PORT36, 0);

which is exactly the scenario described in "GPIO mode pitfalls". Some drivers do this manually, and some use a local pinctrl-ish framework; they're passed big platform data tables with lists of suspend+active GPIO numbers, directions, values and pulls, and then pass those tables back to a library mux-change routine in their suspend/resume handlers.

By my understanding of the general pinctrl concept, we should be converting that to the lovely:

resume:
    pinctrl_pm_select_default_state(dev);
suspend:
    pinctrl_pm_select_sleep_state(dev);

But that means we need to be able to specify the line drives for sleep state through pinctrl tables, which leads us to PIN_CONFIG_OUTPUT, which means controlling the GPIO registers to achieve that. We can do this pretty straightforwardly for the r8a73a4-type case of integrated GPIO+pinctrl - for non-integrated ones, I'm less sure how easy it would be to arrange.

Which is basically an argument against ever using PIN_CONFIG_OUTPUT 0, and the whole of "GPIO mode pitfalls" in pinctrl.txt, isn't it? It means we can't specify idle pinctrl states that drive lines. We have to do the GPIO/function shuffle.

And you're right, it is a little messy in the pin driver implementation, which is what I'm finding, and what leads me here to question the detail. Nevertheless, I've found implementing PIN_CONFIG_OUTPUT on this hardware design is possible, and produces elegant driver+board code.

In my initial prototype, PIN_CONFIG_OUTPUT is only available if the gpio-mode function has been selected. But maybe this could be made hidden and implicit, as per the GPIO API. Eg PIN_CONFIG_OUTPUT/PIN_CONFIG_LOW_POWER_MODE implicitly selects the GPIO mux (for output/input), and PIN_CONFIG_DRIVE_PUSH_PULL/PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_HIGH_IMPEDANCE restores the previously requested?

Well, the pinctrl core does process its tables in order. So in the case where a pinconf setting may interact with a pinmux setting, the ordering that the pinconf+pinmux entries get processed could be significant. Eg if PIN_CONFIG_OUTPUT requires the "gpio-mode" function selected first.
