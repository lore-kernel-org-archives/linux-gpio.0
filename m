The basic concern I have is encoding the current Linux idea of how to
split the subfunctions up into drivers into an ABI - the clocks in CODEC
drivers is the obvious example, they might want to be in the clock API
in future.  If there's a very direct mapping onto individual hardware
blocks that worries me a lot less since it's more obviously reflecting
how the hardware is designed.
