This sounds like something that should be generic, and not use
a bitmask, but offsets. It should work even if the number of
GPIOs from the chip is > 32.

Is the usecase different from hogs?
See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio.txt

There has been extensive discussion about supporting initial values
with something similar to hogs, but I haven't got anything ACKed
by the DT maintainers so it has kind of stalled.

I would make sure to both make it generic, get ACK from the DT
mainatiners, and make sure to implement it in
drivers/gpio/gpiolib-of.c and not locally in drivers.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
