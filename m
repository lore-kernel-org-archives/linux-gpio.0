In fact it's an interrupt controller since it can mask/unmask and control a singal that
can wake up an interrupt for the ARM Core.

Please look at the STM32 EXTI code, the design is quite similar except they don't have a
dynamic management of links, but fixed ones.
They have a proper independant IRQCHIP driver and a link from the pinctrl driver, and this
should be the right design.
They have a flaw since they do the mapping from the gpio_to_irq, and Linus won't allow
this anymore.

You won't need, this interrupt controller will take the number either from DT either
from a mapping creating from the pinctrl driver. The link will only be through the
irq subsystem.

It doesn't fit exactly, but the subsystem can certainly be used to achieve it either by
using all it's capacity or by eventually discussing with the maintainers to adapt it.

Jerome has some hints hot to achieve the pinctrl part with everyone "happy".

Sure, thanks for the work,

Great ! Anyway thanks for your work and I hope this will lead to mainline !
