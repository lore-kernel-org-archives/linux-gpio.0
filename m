That'll work fine for lubbock, but not the others (we can have several
of the others enabled on sa11x0 platforms - eg, badge4 with neponset.)

Yay!

Ignore those for now - the old ARM IRQ stuff was silent on that, but genirq
is more noisy.  I should probably make the sa1111 irqchip handle the both-
edge case itself.

Do you get other SA1111 interrupts (eg, the PS/2 interrupts) delivered?

Hmm, on Neponset with a CF card inserted, I can cat that, and it reports
the CIS.  Any error messages in the kernel log?

That looks hopeful, but the IRQ hasn't been properly assigned (probably
because no driver has bound to the card.)

Indeed, but a tabular approach isn't that painful, especially if we
also insist on knowing an irqdomain as well, which relieves us of
having to know absolute interrupt numbers, which may end up being
dynamically allocated eventually.
