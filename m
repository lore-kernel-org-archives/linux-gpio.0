I forgot to add it, I will do it in the v4.

Unfortunately, no :(

As far as I know there is now way to handle level.
The 0xc register is the IRQ_POL for the GPIO above 32.

It was a typo (too much 'a' in the same word) that I properly fixed in
the v3. (But I still need to fix the title of the patch in the v4)

As we are in the interrupt handler I chose to use this function because
according to its documentation: "This is a fast path alternative to
irq_find_mapping() that can be called directly by irq controller code to
save a handful of instructions".

The only restriction is "It is always safe to call, but won't find irqs
mapped using the radix tree.". So I think that for this driver it is
okay.

As explained in the other patch we will only have one GPIO subnode.

If we have nr_irq_parent > 1, it will work and it is actually expected.

Well the hardware can only manage the edge trigger, so there is no
benefit to modify it each time we want to change the kind of edge we
want (raising or falling). But your comment make me realized that I used
the wrong one, I will move to handle_edge_irq in the v4.

I can reuse a part of the commit log here: "The only unusual "feature"
is that many interrupts are connected to the parent interrupt
controller. But we do not take advantage of this and use the chained irq
with all of them."

After reading the code, it doesn't seem it is the case. At least there
is no irq_of_parse_and_map() call from gpiochip_irqchip_add(). And waht
we need here is to associate each IRQ to the same GPIO handler.

I can still try without this line to confirm it.
