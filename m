Problem is that at request time, we don't know whether the GPIO is to
be used as an interrupt or not.

I think I may have not been clear enough in the HW architecture description.
Indeed, I used the term "mux", but should instead use the term "selector".

The idea is that between the GPIO controllers and the EXTI controller,
there is one selector for each line number, to select the controller used as
interrupt source.

For example, there is a selector on line 0 to select between gpioa0, gpiob0,
gpioc0,.., gpiok0, which one is connected to exti0.

It means there is a HW restriction that makes impossible to use both GPIOA0
or GPIOB0 as interrupts at the same time.

It looks like this: http://pastebin.com/raw/cs2WiNKZ
You can directly check section 12.2.5 of the stm32f429 reference manual:
http://www2.st.com/resource/en/reference_manual/dm00031020.pdf

For example, we can imagine a board where gpioa0 is used SD's card detect,
and gpiob0 used to control a led.

If we set the mux at request time, gpiob0 request may overwrite the mux
configuration set by gpioa0, whereas it is not used as interrupt.

That is the reason why I did it in .to_irq().

Actually, a line is either used by a GPIO, (exclusive) or another purpose.
In the case of a GPIO line, I think we should always go through the gpio.

Actually, this is not a 1:1 relationship, as for example, exti0 can be connected
to either gpioa0, or gpiob0,..., or gpiok0.

So for the exti entries that are connected to gpios, I don't see how
we can reference it
from the exti controller,

Ok, so maybe we need an intermediate layer between gpio and exti to manage the
selectors sysconf?
I wiil have a look in that direction, but I think it could be over-engineered.

Thanks!
