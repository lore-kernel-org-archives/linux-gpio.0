-ACPICA Trace Facility
-
-Copyright (C) 2015, Intel Corporation
-Author: Lv Zheng <lv.zheng@intel.com>
-
-
-Abstract:
-
-This document describes the functions and the interfaces of the method
-tracing facility.
-
-1. Functionalities and usage examples:
-
-   ACPICA provides method tracing capability. And two functions are
-   currently implemented using this capability.
-
-   A. Log reducer
-   ACPICA subsystem provides debugging outputs when CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG is
-   enabled. The debugging messages which are deployed via
-   ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT() macro can be reduced at 2 levels - per-component
-   level (known as debug layer, configured via
-   /sys/module/acpi/parameters/debug_layer) and per-type level (known as
-   debug level, configured via /sys/module/acpi/parameters/debug_level).
-
-   But when the particular layer/level is applied to the control method
-   evaluations, the quantity of the debugging outputs may still be too
-   large to be put into the kernel log buffer. The idea thus is worked out
-   to only enable the particular debug layer/level (normally more detailed)
-   logs when the control method evaluation is started, and disable the
-   detailed logging when the control method evaluation is stopped.
-
-   The following command examples illustrate the usage of the "log reducer"
-   functionality:
-   a. Filter out the debug layer/level matched logs when control methods
-      are being evaluated:
-      # cd /sys/module/acpi/parameters
-      # echo "0xXXXXXXXX" > trace_debug_layer
-      # echo "0xYYYYYYYY" > trace_debug_level
-      # echo "enable" > trace_state
-   b. Filter out the debug layer/level matched logs when the specified
-      control method is being evaluated:
-      # cd /sys/module/acpi/parameters
-      # echo "0xXXXXXXXX" > trace_debug_layer
-      # echo "0xYYYYYYYY" > trace_debug_level
-      # echo "\PPPP.AAAA.TTTT.HHHH" > trace_method_name
-      # echo "method" > /sys/module/acpi/parameters/trace_state
-   c. Filter out the debug layer/level matched logs when the specified
-      control method is being evaluated for the first time:
-      # cd /sys/module/acpi/parameters
-      # echo "0xXXXXXXXX" > trace_debug_layer
-      # echo "0xYYYYYYYY" > trace_debug_level
-      # echo "\PPPP.AAAA.TTTT.HHHH" > trace_method_name
-      # echo "method-once" > /sys/module/acpi/parameters/trace_state
-   Where:
-      0xXXXXXXXX/0xYYYYYYYY: Refer to Documentation/acpi/debug.txt for
-			     possible debug layer/level masking values.
-      \PPPP.AAAA.TTTT.HHHH: Full path of a control method that can be found
-			    in the ACPI namespace. It needn't be an entry
-			    of a control method evaluation.
-
-   B. AML tracer
-
-   There are special log entries added by the method tracing facility at
-   the "trace points" the AML interpreter starts/stops to execute a control
-   method, or an AML opcode. Note that the format of the log entries are
-   subject to change:
-     [    0.186427]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Method Begin [0xf58394d8:\_SB.PCI0.LPCB.ECOK] execution.
-     [    0.186630]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Opcode Begin [0xf5905c88:If] execution.
-     [    0.186820]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Opcode Begin [0xf5905cc0:LEqual] execution.
-     [    0.187010]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Opcode Begin [0xf5905a20:-NamePath-] execution.
-     [    0.187214]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Opcode End [0xf5905a20:-NamePath-] execution.
-     [    0.187407]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Opcode Begin [0xf5905f60:One] execution.
-     [    0.187594]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Opcode End [0xf5905f60:One] execution.
-     [    0.187789]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Opcode End [0xf5905cc0:LEqual] execution.
-     [    0.187980]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Opcode Begin [0xf5905cc0:Return] execution.
-     [    0.188146]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Opcode Begin [0xf5905f60:One] execution.
-     [    0.188334]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Opcode End [0xf5905f60:One] execution.
-     [    0.188524]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Opcode End [0xf5905cc0:Return] execution.
-     [    0.188712]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Opcode End [0xf5905c88:If] execution.
-     [    0.188903]   exdebug-0398 ex_trace_point        : Method End [0xf58394d8:\_SB.PCI0.LPCB.ECOK] execution.
-
-   Developers can utilize these special log entries to track the AML
-   interpretion, thus can aid issue debugging and performance tuning. Note
-   that, as the "AML tracer" logs are implemented via ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT()
-   macro, CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG is also required to be enabled for enabling
-   "AML tracer" logs.
-
-   The following command examples illustrate the usage of the "AML tracer"
-   functionality:
-   a. Filter out the method start/stop "AML tracer" logs when control
-      methods are being evaluated:
-      # cd /sys/module/acpi/parameters
-      # echo "0x80" > trace_debug_layer
-      # echo "0x10" > trace_debug_level
-      # echo "enable" > trace_state
-   b. Filter out the method start/stop "AML tracer" when the specified
-      control method is being evaluated:
-      # cd /sys/module/acpi/parameters
-      # echo "0x80" > trace_debug_layer
-      # echo "0x10" > trace_debug_level
-      # echo "\PPPP.AAAA.TTTT.HHHH" > trace_method_name
-      # echo "method" > trace_state
-   c. Filter out the method start/stop "AML tracer" logs when the specified
-      control method is being evaluated for the first time:
-      # cd /sys/module/acpi/parameters
-      # echo "0x80" > trace_debug_layer
-      # echo "0x10" > trace_debug_level
-      # echo "\PPPP.AAAA.TTTT.HHHH" > trace_method_name
-      # echo "method-once" > trace_state
-   d. Filter out the method/opcode start/stop "AML tracer" when the
-      specified control method is being evaluated:
-      # cd /sys/module/acpi/parameters
-      # echo "0x80" > trace_debug_layer
-      # echo "0x10" > trace_debug_level
-      # echo "\PPPP.AAAA.TTTT.HHHH" > trace_method_name
-      # echo "opcode" > trace_state
-   e. Filter out the method/opcode start/stop "AML tracer" when the
-      specified control method is being evaluated for the first time:
-      # cd /sys/module/acpi/parameters
-      # echo "0x80" > trace_debug_layer
-      # echo "0x10" > trace_debug_level
-      # echo "\PPPP.AAAA.TTTT.HHHH" > trace_method_name
-      # echo "opcode-opcode" > trace_state
-
-  Note that all above method tracing facility related module parameters can
-  be used as the boot parameters, for example:
-      acpi.trace_debug_layer=0x80 acpi.trace_debug_level=0x10 \
-      acpi.trace_method_name=\_SB.LID0._LID acpi.trace_state=opcode-once
-
-2. Interface descriptions:
-
-   All method tracing functions can be configured via ACPI module
-   parameters that are accessible at /sys/module/acpi/parameters/:
-
-   trace_method_name
-	The full path of the AML method that the user wants to trace.
-	Note that the full path shouldn't contain the trailing "_"s in its
-	name segments but may contain "\" to form an absolute path.
-
-   trace_debug_layer
-	The temporary debug_layer used when the tracing feature is enabled.
-	Using ACPI_EXECUTER (0x80) by default, which is the debug_layer
-	used to match all "AML tracer" logs.
-
-   trace_debug_level
-	The temporary debug_level used when the tracing feature is enabled.
-	Using ACPI_LV_TRACE_POINT (0x10) by default, which is the
-	debug_level used to match all "AML tracer" logs.
-
-   trace_state
-	The status of the tracing feature.
-	Users can enable/disable this debug tracing feature by executing
-	the following command:
-	    # echo string > /sys/module/acpi/parameters/trace_state
-	Where "string" should be one of the following:
-	"disable"
-	    Disable the method tracing feature.
-	"enable"
-	    Enable the method tracing feature.
-	    ACPICA debugging messages matching
-	    "trace_debug_layer/trace_debug_level" during any method
-	    execution will be logged.
-	"method"
-	    Enable the method tracing feature.
-	    ACPICA debugging messages matching
-	    "trace_debug_layer/trace_debug_level" during method execution
-	    of "trace_method_name" will be logged.
-	"method-once"
-	    Enable the method tracing feature.
-	    ACPICA debugging messages matching
-	    "trace_debug_layer/trace_debug_level" during method execution
-	    of "trace_method_name" will be logged only once.
-	"opcode"
-	    Enable the method tracing feature.
-	    ACPICA debugging messages matching
-	    "trace_debug_layer/trace_debug_level" during method/opcode
-	    execution of "trace_method_name" will be logged.
-	"opcode-once"
-	    Enable the method tracing feature.
-	    ACPICA debugging messages matching
-	    "trace_debug_layer/trace_debug_level" during method/opcode
-	    execution of "trace_method_name" will be logged only once.
-	Note that, the difference between the "enable" and other feature
-        enabling options are:
-	1. When "enable" is specified, since
-	   "trace_debug_layer/trace_debug_level" shall apply to all control
-	   method evaluations, after configuring "trace_state" to "enable",
-	   "trace_method_name" will be reset to NULL.
-	2. When "method/opcode" is specified, if
-	   "trace_method_name" is NULL when "trace_state" is configured to
-	   these options, the "trace_debug_layer/trace_debug_level" will
-	   apply to all control method evaluations.

+      "trace_debug_layer/trace_debug_level" during method/opcode
+      execution of "trace_method_name" will be logged only once.
+
+Note that, the difference between the "enable" and other feature
+enabling options are:
+
+1. When "enable" is specified, since
+   "trace_debug_layer/trace_debug_level" shall apply to all control
+   method evaluations, after configuring "trace_state" to "enable",
+   "trace_method_name" will be reset to NULL.
+2. When "method/opcode" is specified, if
+   "trace_method_name" is NULL when "trace_state" is configured to
+   these options, the "trace_debug_layer/trace_debug_level" will
+   apply to all control method evaluations.
