+Abstract
+========
 The Linux ACPI subsystem converts ACPI namespace objects into a Linux
 device tree under the /sys/devices/LNXSYSTEM:00 and updates it upon
-receiving ACPI hotplug notification events.  For each device object in this
-hierarchy there is a corresponding symbolic link in the
+receiving ACPI hotplug notification events.  For each device object
+in this hierarchy there is a corresponding symbolic link in the
 /sys/bus/acpi/devices.
+
 This document illustrates the structure of the ACPI device tree.
 
+ACPI Definition Blocks
+======================
+
+The ACPI firmware sets up RSDP (Root System Description Pointer) in the
+system memory address space pointing to the XSDT (Extended System
+Description Table).  The XSDT always points to the FADT (Fixed ACPI
+Description Table) using its first entry, the data within the FADT
+includes various fixed-length entries that describe fixed ACPI features
+of the hardware.  The FADT contains a pointer to the DSDT
+(Differentiated System Descripition Table).  The XSDT also contains
+entries pointing to possibly multiple SSDTs (Secondary System
+Description Table).
+
+The DSDT and SSDT data is organized in data structures called definition
+blocks that contain definitions of various objects, including ACPI
+control methods, encoded in AML (ACPI Machine Language).  The data block
+of the DSDT along with the contents of SSDTs represents a hierarchical
+data structure called the ACPI namespace whose topology reflects the
+structure of the underlying hardware platform.
+
+The relationships between ACPI System Definition Tables described above
+are illustrated in the following diagram::

-
-   ACPI device (i.e. struct acpi_device) objects may be linked to other

-   (for example, devices on the PCI bus).  If that happens, it means that
-   the ACPI device object is a "companion" of a device otherwise
-   represented in a different way and is used (1) to provide configuration
-   information on that device which cannot be obtained by other means and
-   (2) to do specific things to the device with the help of its ACPI
-   control methods.  One ACPI device object may be linked this way to
-   multiple "physical" devices.
-
-   If an ACPI device object is linked to a "physical" device, its sysfs
-   directory contains the "physical_node" symbolic link to the sysfs
-   directory of the target device object.  In turn, the target device's
-   sysfs directory will then contain the "firmware_node" symbolic link to
-   the sysfs directory of the companion ACPI device object.
-   The linking mechanism relies on device identification provided by the
-   ACPI namespace.  For example, if there's an ACPI namespace object
-   representing a PCI device (i.e. a device object under an ACPI namespace
-   object representing a PCI bridge) whose _ADR returns 0x00020000 and the
-   bus number of the parent PCI bridge is 0, the sysfs directory
-   representing the struct acpi_device object created for that ACPI
-   namespace object will contain the 'physical_node' symbolic link to the
-   /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02:0/ sysfs directory of the
-   corresponding PCI device.
-
-   The linking mechanism is generally bus-specific.  The core of its
-   implementation is located in the drivers/acpi/glue.c file, but there are
-   complementary parts depending on the bus types in question located
-   elsewhere.  For example, the PCI-specific part of it is located in
