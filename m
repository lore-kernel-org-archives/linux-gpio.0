Agreed. It doesn't, with the new ABI. Not for technical reasons, at all.

With the new ABI it is possible to set a "label" for the gpiochip, currently
described as "a functional name for this GPIO chip, such as a product
number" and it's certainly possible to manage this name carefully for
a system to look up a certain chip.

This should work fine AFAICT. All the ABI and information is in place
to deal with this.
