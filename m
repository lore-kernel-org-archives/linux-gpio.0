I'm not really sure what the key impediment to it working is.

You don't need to go all the way to SPARSEMEM, there is DISCONTIGMEM
which IIUI is quite a bit simpler.

I'd actually be interested to know what happens (ie. breaks) if you just
add the two memblocks and leave the hole in between. Is it the generic
code that breaks or is it something in the powerpc code? If it's the
later maybe we can do a small fix/hack to work around that.

Or it just needs to know where the "wii hole" is, and it can skip that
region, that should be doable, but whether it actually works I'm not
100% sure.

Thanks.
