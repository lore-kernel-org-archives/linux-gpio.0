I understand the issue, but still the dts is not the right place
for this comment.

 From the original bootlog:

armada-nand armada-nand.0: Initialize HAL based NFC in 8bit mode with=20
DMA Disabled using BCH 4bit ECC

that translates into

nand-ecc-strength =3D <4>;
nand-ecc-step-size =3D <512>;

Ok, the above partition isn't passed by the bootloader on mtdparts
cmdline, i.e. that is why you call it "hardwired" ?

Just remove the comment, actually the whole partition table is
"hacked" into the stock bootloader.

Yeah, leave the original partition table. Any other, smarter
bootloader can replace it.

Please always leave the Cc-list in place.

And you should relax and leave patches there a day or two (or three).
Not everybody is reading patches immediately.

We are in no hurry, the current merge window is already closed,
the new one is 6 weeks away.
