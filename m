If I understand it, sould I make some GPIO device?

I realy don't understan it, isn't it done in GPIO framework? Please, co=
ul'd
you explain it more.

I try to find something about /aliases, but without success.
In fact, I have that problem with serial too, this is my /aliases:
	aliases {
		serial0 =3D &dbgu;
		serial2 =3D &usart0; /* SBUS */
		serial3 =3D &usart1; /* RS1 */
		serial5 =3D &usart2; /* EBUS */
		serial4 =3D &usart3; /* RS2 */
	};
and this is my ttyS:
ttyS0
ttyS1
ttyS3
ttyS4
ttyS5

Thank a lot
Jiri
