Yes.

Well, I'd suggest not adding that fallback code now, but simply add a
check in gpiochip_add_data_with_key to ensure ngpio is sane (and refuse
to register the chip otherwise), at least if we know that every
currently supported/known chip is covered by the 256 (?). That keeps the
code simple and fast, and then if somebody has a chip with 40000 gpio
lines, we can add a fallback path. Or we could consider alternative
solutions, to avoid a 10000 byte GFP_ATOMIC allocation (maybe hang a
pre-allocation off the gpio_chip; that's only two more bits per
descriptor, and there's already a whole gpio_desc for each - but not
sure about the locking in that case).
