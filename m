OK, I just tried a little test and it did as I expected, I was able to
select a symbol and it did not enable its dependency, so this would
break build. So, I'm still confused, why does REGMAP_I2C depending
on I2C matter? What are you suggesting my Kconfig should look like?

I was giving a generic description of a PMIC, I didn't really want to
list all the features and start marketing the part in the Kconfig, unless
you want, I'm sure TI won't mind the advertisement. :)

I'm not sure why we write so much about these driver parts at all in the
help, people who need them know what they are, it's not like some core
kernel config option that people might be undecided on and need explained
its function.

I'm finding in drivers/mfd ~89% of drivers mention at some point that
they are a driver. But I do admit my original statement was based on a
quick monte carlo selection of a couple files. :)

Still not sure this describes the file, maybe we could just drop that
line completely from files with an obvious purpose? Doesn't really bother
me ether way.
