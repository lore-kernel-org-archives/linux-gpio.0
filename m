Sure, I'll just have to hunt through all the patches to find an occurance
of the include to fix them all up...

I prefer my method by a long shot - it's always going to work because
the gpiochip is embedded within the gpio_reg structure, and the compiler
is inteligent enough to keep a single pointer around.  With your
suggestion, the compiler has no idea that 'r' and 'gc' are actually
the same pointer, but a different type, and we end up having to carry
around identical pointers in two registers rather than just one.

It makes more sense to use gpiochip_get_data() if gpio_chip were a const
data structure that was never embedded, but the way *gpiochip_add*()
writes to the structure and the presence of members like "base" prevents
that.

Yes, to avoid problems with the transition to it - the legacy APIs
(such as ASSABET_BCR_frob(), etc) can be called really early, so we
need the gpiochip available early as well so we can keep the legacy
APIs working until they can be killed off.  There's some corner
cases in the assabet code which make that difficult at the moment.

This whole patch set is still very much a work-in-progress - there's
more that needs doing, but I wanted to get _this_ out there so that
people can reviewing it, and hopefully get it queued for the next
merge window.
