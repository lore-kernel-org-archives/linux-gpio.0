I'm not familiar with exactly how the RPi handles its pin muxing, but
even if it requires userspace interaction that should not prevent having
firmware describe the pins.

In general, if the hardware configuration is static we use device trees.

If the configuration is dynamic we use device-tree overlays; either
loaded manually or by some service (e.g. Beaglebone capes). Perhaps this
could be handled by the RPi helper.

And for experimentation / development, firmware could even be totally
non-restrictive by simply declaring generic pin "functions" like
"expansion-pin-4" and even allow for the direction to be changed.
