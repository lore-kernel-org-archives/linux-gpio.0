We used to have a configuration per pin in our products. On next ones we
will have some constraints ie. on the controller side we still have a
configuration per pin but we will introduced the notion of iosets. This
notion involves that timings are guaranteed only in one ioset. That's
why we can't mix signals from several iosets because. On the controller side
we can do all we want so I would like to use groups as a software protection.

I have several groups because I can only choose the 4bit group and use other
pins for an other device.

Example:

mci0 {
	mci0_ioset0_1bit_grp {
		pins = <PINMUX_PIN(68, 2),
			PINMUX_PIN(69, 2),
			PINMUX_PIN(70, 2)>;
	};
	mci0_ioset0_4bit_grp {
		pins = <PINMUX_PIN(68, 2),
			PINMUX_PIN(69, 2),
			PINMUX_PIN(70, 2),
			PINMUX_PIN(71, 2),
			PINMUX_PIN(72, 2),
			PINMUX_PIN(73, 2)>;
	};
	mci0_ioset0_8bit_grp {
		pins = <PINMUX_PIN(68, 2),
			PINMUX_PIN(69, 2),
			PINMUX_PIN(70, 2),
			PINMUX_PIN(71, 2),
			PINMUX_PIN(72, 2),
			PINMUX_PIN(73, 2),
			PINMUX_PIN(74, 2),
			PINMUX_PIN(75, 2),
			PINMUX_PIN(76, 2),
			PINMUX_PIN(77, 2)>;
	};
	mci0_ioset1_1bit_grp {
		pins = <PINMUX_PIN(153, 1),
			PINMUX_PIN(154, 1),
			PINMUX_PIN(155, 1)>;
	};
};

i2c0 {
	i2c0_ioset0_grp {
		pins  = <PINMUX_PIN(71, 4),
			 PINMUX_PIN(72, 4)>;
	};
	i2c0_ioset1_grp {
		pins  = <PINMUX_PIN(91, 6),
			 PINMUX_PIN(92, 6)>;
	};
	i2c0_ioset2_grp {
		pins  = <PINMUX_PIN(108, 1),
			 PINMUX_PIN(109, 1)>;
	};
};

Yes I would like to put it in the dtsi file. For sure we will have big
dtbs. If we put that in the driver we will increase the size of our
kernel. If every one does this, we will have a lot of unused code for a
multiplatform kernel. Where is the best place to put this?

Thanks for the links. Well I had a look to them and now I am a bit
lost...

I agree with this binding but it involves to get rid of
pinconf_generic_dt_node_to_map_all, isn't it? What do group and function
become? It seems these concepts have disappeared.

I am disappointed because I have the feeling that the only remaining
part of the generic pinconf are the configuration properties.
