Providing that people remember that this is what's going on here and
that they remember that for this mux this shortened name is used rather
than the full one.  We're relatively consistent in doing this for most
drivers, it's helpful that "I want to connect X to Y" usually translates
directly into one of "amixer cset X Y" or "amixer cset 'X Y' on".

Right, but as I said on the initial version in the case where you care
the user probably shouldn't have the ability to set them independently
in the first place.
