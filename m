Is the intention here to have this as a hint to the driver that
it needs to restore the state, or as something the core will act
upon and restore the state for you?

I am not sure these are strictly analogous, my patch is about
the consumer of the GPIO specifying if it can tolerate the state
being dropped whilst in suspend. Whereas this patch appears to be
concerned with whether the state of the controller needs restored
on resume.

I guess in our case we didn't really consider the restore aspect
because we essentially get that for free from regmap. Regmap
cache's all our register state and provides a mechanism to sync
that back to the hardware, so we simply invoke that on resume and
all our GPIO/pinctrl state is restored.

Just to make sure I understand this property is used to specify a
pinctrl state that will be automatically applied by the hardware when
entering suspend? Kind of an odd one, feels like something you
could just have the software apply as part of the suspend
process. Almost would have wondered should this be a driver
specific binding rather than a generic pinctrl one?

I guess from looking at the driver using this I assume that said
hardware also automatically replies the non-sleep settings on
resume?
