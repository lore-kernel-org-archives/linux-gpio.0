Does it actually make sense to replace it?  Or rather extend
it via the chardev. I've not really been following the discussion
though if you've already addressed this.

Seems sensible to me.

Absolutely.

Useful to what?  What is going to read this info? (debugfs?)

We don't support multiple listeners in IIO.  Maybe some combination
of that and evdev which spins off a separate fifo for each listener.

Perhaps use anonymous file handles for each case.  So the exposed
chardev is simply there for configuration of what others will do.
Then you can have an ioctl to get an anonymous file handle for each of
(with the appropriate description of what it is handling).

* Read multiple inputs
* Write multiple outputs
(for both of these are you distinguishing between cases where you an guarantee
they happen simultaneously and others where they are just close in time? 
Makes a huge difference in some cases obviously - such as reading from a parallel
ADC - or writing to a DAC).

* Events - though that could probably be shared with a read multiple inputs
chardev - or maybe not if it's about different pins...

Re reading above I guess you may already mean this by one file for multiple
things?

Are you thinking one file descriptor for one pin (for events) or
handling more complex registrations?  I can see the infrastructure
for this getting rapidly complex.

Could do it with irq_chips like we do in IIO triggers - so you can
have one irq fire multiple listening devices...

Good luck ;)

I've been thinking about how to handle logic analyzer type
inputs in IIO for a while.  One example is beaglelogic with it's around
100MHz sampling of 8 channels, It might be interesting to use some of
this same gpio infrastructure to play around with the ideas (though probably
not the actual beaglelogic data flows - that will need some large block transfer
tricks) - particularly once you have nice functions to feed sets of gpios
from arbitrary locations out on a read.

Clearly there would be some overlap, but I doubt you'll get into the
complexity of triggered captures etc here or at least not without jumping
to userspace and back again.  Some gpio chips do support this sort of 
sampling, but I suspect they aren't going to be found in many 'normal'
systems. (e.g. an input bank latch on event).

Anyhow, this was really just a request to keep any data handling/merging
infrastructure nicely separated from the front end bit spitting it out of
a chardev as there are/may be other usecases.
