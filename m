You can take a look at device_link_add() and Co.

But it's little bit unclear what exactly you have issue with:
- shutdown
- suspend

above are different (at least as it was before) and gpio-brcmstb.c
  brcmstb_gpio_shutdown() should not be called as part of suspend !?
may be you mean brcmstb_gpio_suspend?
