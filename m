Ok if there's going to be read/volatile regs and defaults then it makes
sense to leave the defines in some shared header file, which is
unfortunate for the independent merge of driver bits. Either way, I
would prefer we don't use struct lochnagar in this driver and move to
more generic structures like struct regmap and express the type of MFD
to this device driver some other way.

Thanks!
