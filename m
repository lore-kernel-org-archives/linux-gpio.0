What is needed is a 1:1 mapping between GPIO offsets and IRQ
offsets.

If you just number your GPIOs 0...n and your IRQs 0...n
it should work just fine with one irqchip for all banks.

What screws things up is likely that the hardware supports
32 lines per bank and not all are used.

I suggest you enable 32 line and 32 IRQs per bank,
so that hwirq maps nicely 1:1 on the GPIO offsets,
then just use the width thing to NACK operations on
GPIO lines you are not using. This way you can also
decode and warn on spurious IRQs on the unused lines.
