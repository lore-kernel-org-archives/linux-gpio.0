If this change turns out to be wrong it doesn't necessarily have to stay
in the core pinctrl code. It can be pushed back into the AT91 driver
(and the others using it), won't be used for new bindings and after some
years can be pushed into some dark corner.

I welcome the addition of the combined pin number / mux value
properties like we have in the Mediatek driver. Making the pinctrl
core aware of these defines like Ludovic did is a good idea IMO.
