Okay, if people think defining the GPIO base number in DT properties as 
a temporary, transient solution is not acceptable, I can switch the 
driver to use dynamic GPIO number allocation (by setting gpio base to a 
negative number and let gpiochip_add find a usable base number).

Like I said previously, dynamic GPIO allocation works fine in the 
kernel, as long as all of our GPIO clients in the kernel use gpiod based 
API, which is what we will enforce going forward. The only problem is 
with some of our customers who use GPIO through sysfs and expect fixed 
global GPIO numbers. Thinking about this more, it's probably not that 
difficult to add a script for those customers to convert/map the GPIO 
numbers based on readings parsed from sysfs, so I guess that's fine.

I'll submit v6 patchset with DT property "linux,gpio-base" removed.
