Hi Stephen,

Sorry I did not get to v1 and v2 in a timely manner.

The how to architect connectors and plugs threads fell asleep before
coming to a resolution.  We need to revive that discussion.

One of the concepts of the plug and connector architecture is that
a main board may contain multiple connectors of the same type (or
different types, but the same type is sufficient for this discussion).

The node describing the card that plugs into one of the connectors
does not know the phandle of the connector it is going to be
connected to.  Some other mechanism is provided to allow a card
to be plugged into any of the available connectors.  If there are
two identical cards plugged into two connectors, then both cards
have the same exact device tree node.  But some mechanism will
exist to resolve (or "link") the two card nodes to the different
connector nodes.

As a result of this, in the above example the reset-gpios property
in the node 'expansion_device' can not contain '&connector'.  The
concept of &connector belongs to the entire expansion_device node,
not to individual properties within the node.

I'm not sure where this puts us.  I'm thinking....
