I should also add: right now persistance is defined in negative terms,
you can supply the flag "may lose value", which means the subsystem
by default, and driver by default, will try to keep values persistent across
sleep.

Then it is possible to opt in for not doing so. (Usually to save power I
think.)

I think that especially for userspace use cases, saving power should
not really be the concern, but correct me if I'm wrong. I am thinking
of a box with a DC plug wired up to a factory line here.

What we have in the Arizona driver is an opt-in where the DT can
say "don't preserve the value  this line during system sleep" i.e. "lay lose
value" and we can extend that flag to mean "don't preserve this line
during reset either" but by default assume that we should.

Yours,
