So far, I've seen two types of solutions:
- One based on a stacked irqchip driver that implements the inverter on
the irq_set_type method
- One based on per-device vendor-specific properties in DT

While the first one is clearly a big hammer, it has the advantage of not
adding new stuff to the DT spec, and accurately describe the signal path
(see the mediatek stuff for reference).

The second one is just a hack, frankly. It just has the advantage of
being trivial to implement.

I'm clearly inclined to prefer the first solution. But maybe it is time
to invent a "generic inverter" driver that could be reusable, just like
we have a generic irqchip?

Thanks,
