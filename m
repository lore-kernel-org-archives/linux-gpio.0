AFAIK the firmware only uses the pinctrl at boot to set the initial
values and the OS owns it after boot. The only interaction I know of
after boot are GPIO signaled events, but those are executed under the
control of the OS.

I don't understand the part about firmware being put in charge of
runtime power management. Do you mean that the firmware directly
accesses the pinctrl registers? Doesn't this contradict the ACPI goal
of having the OS control power management? Or do you mean accessing
pinctrl registers via _PSx and PowerResource._On/_Off?

There is noting specified in the spec about other controllers, why is
pinctrl special in this regard?

I assume you are suggesting something like the following: we have a
device that is powered via a GPIO and associated ACPI _PS3/_PS0
methods are poking the pinctrl register to drive 0 or 1 to power on or
off the device.

If that is the case, we can easily break that today, by changing that
particular GPIO value via, e.g., sysfs.
