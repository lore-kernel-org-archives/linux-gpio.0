Hi Andre,

This was actually requested during the initial driver submission
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2012-December/136809.html

And I actually came to like it, even though the initial port is indeed
quite painful, for several reasons:

1) In those times, we didn't have a datasheet available for all these
SoCs, so no easy way to find out the value to set in the register to
mux a particular function in. These days are mostly over, but we're
still in that situation for a few SoCs (mostly the R* and H* SoCs
though).

2) It's quite easy to read and debug, at least from the DT PoV. The
pain mostly comes from writing that table in the first place, but the
alternative other SoCs have picked to have something readable in the
DT is a SoC specific header file with the defines of all the functions
availables for all the pins, which is just as painful to write and
review, and is essentialy the same thing.

3) It's easy to maintain. If one of the entry in the table came to be
wrong, we simply have to update the table, it's completely contained
in the kernel itself and doesn't require fixing (and updating) the DT.

4) It allows to catch misconfiguration in the cases where you set a
function on a pin that doesn't support it as well, which is also quite
convenient, and wouldn't be possible at all in the case of a header,
or simply open-coding the value.

There's also the interrupts over GPIOs that change slightly, the A20
having a single bank and the A64 having several of them.

The interrupt mechanism is quite interesting, since it's also a muxing
option of a given pin, and only a few pins implement that option. On
the A20 and earlier, we had 32 interrupts scattered around the
available pins, on A31 and later, we still have the same mechanism,
this time with multiple banks of 32 interrupts.

We have to have a table somewhere as well to give the mapping a pin
and the interrupt that might be connected to it.

I guess in the such a case you wouldn't need the function string at
all then?
