I don't see how it hurts to treat it generically. Presumably
that's the way it will be done on ACPI platforms going forward?
No need to tie it to some ACPI HID.

I'm trying to resolve everything at once: gpios, pinctrl pins,
and irqs exposed by the TLMM hardware. The value is that we solve
it all, once, now. The DT binding can also be resolved at the
same time, so when we need to express this in DT it's already
done. Otherwise, something can request irqs from the irqdomain
even if the irq can't be enabled, or it can try to mux the pin to
some other function, even if the function selection can't be
configured.

Boiling everything down into the irq valid mask should cover all
these cases, and not require us to strip const from all the data
in the non-ACPI pinctrl drivers to replace the value in the npins
field at runtime.
