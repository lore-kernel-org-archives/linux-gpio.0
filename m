Let me ask: what is the difference between kernel exported gpios and us=
er space?
User-space interface is good enough for usage gpios, so why write other=
 driver
doing the same. What only we like is export board layout gpio from kern=
el
using dt.

Exactly we like to export "out0" ... "out7". If user will use some of t=
hem for
"GARAGE_DOOR" is up to him. But he knows that somewhere on some connect=
or on
the board is "out0" and he will find "out0" in "sysfs". Not strange "gp=
ioA25"
and set by default as input.
Thats all what we need.

Short example:

			gpio-name =3D "in13";
			input;
			gpio =3D <&pioC 18 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		};
		in14 {
			gpio-name =3D "in14";
			input;
			gpio =3D <&pioC 20 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		};
		in17 {
			gpio-name =3D "in17";
			input;
			gpio =3D <&pioC 16 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		};
		out18 {
			gpio-name =3D "out18";
			gpio =3D <&pioA 30 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
			output;
			init-low;
		};
		out19 {
			gpio-name =3D "out19";
			gpio =3D <&pioA 31 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
			output;
			init-low;
		};
		out20 {
			gpio-name =3D "out20";
			gpio =3D <&pioA 29 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
			output;
			init-low;
