Register values don't belong in a device tree. And it's totally fine to
have data in the kernel, too. We do it all the time.

ABI stability means that, yes, you have to keep maintaining the existing
tables forever, else old DTBs will stop working if you rip out the
static tables that drivers depend on.

Given that DT is an ABI you should treat it the same way as other ABIs.
You can't rely on the DT being correct. Rather you have to make sure to
validate it before you hand the content to hardware. If you allow direct
register access to your hardware via DT and don't validate, it becomes
really easy for people to exploit it.

This is not the same as saying we need to be able to fully validate all
aspects of device tree. We can't, because some information simply does
not exist outside of DT. However, I think it's a big mistake to trust a
user to fully know about all intricacies of a pinmux and not make any
mistake when writing the device tree. What if one of the settings causes
the board to go up in flames?

That's a different matter. If you've got bugs in the tables, then go fix
the tables. However the assumption here is that you've done at least a
minimum of testing and your driver didn't cause your board to go up in
flames. When patches were posted, people had the opportunity to review
the tables for correctness. However, if you put all of the flexibility
into DT, you also put all of the risk there. People may just make some
stupid mistake and cause physical damage to their hardware.

Why? This is data that is implied by the compatible string and static
per SoC. There is no way you can change the mapping in DT. What does
need to go into DT is the configuration of the pinmux, that is, what
function is used for each pin on a given board.

If you haven't documented the strings your binding is not complete.
That's a bug and should be fixed. Also, it is occasionally acceptable to
break compatibility (it's technically only breaking if somebody notices)
and fixing bugs in bindings has in the past been one of the exceptions
where breaking ABI was specifically allowed.

However, the kind of breakage we're talking about here is total. If you
rip out the static tables from your driver, you don't have any data to
replace the missing information and none of the driver will work. This
is different from the driver erroring out trying to configure a pin for
the NAND function because it couldn't match the name.

Also, device tree bindings are not documentation for how to write a
driver. They are not a replacement for hardware documentation. Nobody
should be expected to be able to write an OS driver solely based on a
device tree binding. Device tree bindings are more of a configuration
interface specification for OS drivers.

The kernel is full of data:

	$ objdump -h build/arm64/vmlinux
	[...]
	  1 .text         009c99c0  ffff000008081000  ffff000008081000  00011000  2**11
	                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, READONLY, CODE
	  2 .rodata       00403bf8  ffff000008a50000  ffff000008a50000  009e0000  2**12
	                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, DATA
	[...]

So that's about 40% of the kernel image. Code really is no good without
data to process.

Yeah, I've heard this before. To be honest, I think these tables are the
kind of data that you should generate, and once you do that it becomes
extremely cheap to add the data to other DT consumers.

And let's face it: the really difficult part of adding pinmux support is
to write the driver (or subsystem if you don't have one yet). Adding the
data is really the easy part.

Every driver is very SoC specific information. There's never been an
objection to having SoC specific drivers in the kernel. And back at the
time the discussion was as much about the development process and code
structure than it was about board files.

The majority of the improvements over the years have been achieved by
moving drivers out of arch/arm and moving board files to DT. The goal
was never to get rid of all data.
