This is seriously getting out of control. We already come to great
length (and sometimes a painful amount of hacks) to satisfy a few
individuals with a theorical interest in backward compatibility (and
apparently, we're even the only one doing so, even more platforms
choosing to not support that as we speak), there's seriously no reason
to support forward compatibility as well. This has *never* been a
thing, never has been documented nor advertised, I don't know why it
should be one more thing to carry on our shoulders.

Only maybe to slow us even more in the process, and effectively
prevent us from doing any actual work.

When do you draw the line exactly? You could have the same argument
for any feature that will be supported in the future... Do you also
want to backport any given driver for any kernel version?

This is ridiculous. 4.9 didn't have MMC support. Who cares about
whether MMC (or any other driver) works? This was never supposed to!

And what about the situation that you encountered last week too? IE
the compatibility was introduced because it was convenient, and it
turns out it's not working as expected?

We remove the bogus compatible from the list? But then, we can't boot
anymore on older kernels...
