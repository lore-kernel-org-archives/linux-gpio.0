What I wanted to point out is that it is probably ok to just duplicate the 
string at all times, since the probability that res->name will not be NULL 
*and* the string will already match what we expect is very low (and could 
only come from a device tree that is aware of this patch).

Leakage is not a concern thanks to devm, as you have pointed out.

Mmm, is this how things really work? My understanding is that 
devm-allocated resources will be freed after the driver's remove function 
is called (see slides 11/12 of 
http://haifux.org/lectures/323/haifux-devres.pdf). I.e. when the module is 
unloaded, your string will be destroyed. So unless I am missing something 
you would still need to duplicate it the next time the device is probed.

So here it seems to me that to be on the safe side you either need to 
restore the previous value of res->name on device destruction, or always 
duplicate the string when probing it. But with this later solution there is 
still the risk that if you then load *another* driver to probe this device, 
which will then find a valid pointer on res->name, only to find invalid 
content when following it... So in the end I'd recommend against messing 
with resources like that - it just creates potential for invalid states.

Hopefully is my following suggestion is valid, you won't need to.

I think your problem can be summarized as follows: for each device, you 
need to call bgpio_init() with the proper parameters. Your goal is to infer 
the right parameters for a variety a devices that make a different use of 
the device tree.

Because of this, you *will* need device-specific DT-parsing functions, and 
your current patch already contains them (like clps711x_parse_dt()). My 
suggestion is to not rely on bgpio_pdev_probe() for these specific devices, 
as this function expects resources, and forces you to so some unclear 
hacking. Instead, how about something like the following (warning, this is 
dirty and just to let you get the idea):

/* Params to bgpio_init()  */
struct bgpio_params {
    unsigned long sz;
    void __iomem *dat;
    void __iomem *set;
    void __iomem *clr;
    void __iomem *dirout;
    void __iomem *dirin;
    unsigned long flags;

    struct bgpio_pdata pdata;
};

static int clps711x_parse_dt(struct platform_device *pdev,
		struct bgpio_params *params)
{
	struct device_node *np = pdev->dev.of_node;
	struct resource *res;
	void __iomem *mem;
	int id = np ? of_alias_get_id(np, "gpio") : pdev->id;

	params->pdata.base = id * 8;

	res = platform_get_resource(pdev, IORESOURCE_MEM, 0);
	if (!res)
		return -EINVAL;
	params->dat = devm_ioremap_resource(&pdev->dev, res);

	res = platform_get_resource(pdev, IORESOURCE_MEM, 1);
	if (!res)
		return -EINVAL;
	mem = devm_ioremap_resource(&pdev->dev, res);

	switch (id) {
	case 0:
	case 1:
	case 2:
		pdata->ngpio = 0; /* determined by register width */
		params->dirout = mem;
		break;
	case 3:
		pdata->ngpio = 0; /* determined by register width */
		/* PORTD is inverted logic for direction register */
		params->dirin = mem;
		break;
	case 4:
		pdata->ngpio = 3; /* PORTE is 3 lines only */
		params->dirout = mem;
		break;
	default:
		return -ENODEV;
	}

	return 0;
}

static int bgpio_pdev_probe(struct platform_device *pdev)
{
    /* clear params out */
    struct bgpio_params params = { 0 };
    const int (*parse_dt)(struct platform_device *,
                          struct bgpio_params *);

    parse_dt = of_device_get_match_data(&pdev->dev);
    /* We are not instanciated from the DT, do regular probe using 
resources */
    if (!parse_dt) {
        struct resource *r;

        r = platform_get_resource_byname(pdev, IORESOURCE_MEM, "dat");
        if (!r)
                return -EINVAL;

        params.sz = resource_size(r);

        params.dat = bgpio_map(pdev, "dat", sz);
        if (IS_ERR(params.dat))
                return PTR_ERR(params.dat);

        /* etc, fill in params by doing what bgpio_pdev_probe initially did 
*/
    } else {
        /* instanciated from DT, fill in params with the device-specific 
function */
        parse_dt(pdev, &params);
        pdata = &params.pdata;
    }

    ....
 
    err = bgpio_init(gc, dev, params.sz, params.dat, params.set, 
params.clr, params.dirout, params.dirin, params.flags);
    ....
}

... or something like that, it is probably possible to make this cleaner by 
refactoring the code a bit (bgpio_pdata and my new params structure can 
probably be merged, for instance).

You get the same result, but without messing with resources in dangerous 
ways, and also removing one level of callback (and some hard-to-follow 
macros). Of course parse_dt functions can be shared across devices when 
they are compatible. Feel also free to adopt another approach (like 
returning the struct resource in bgpio_params instead of the mapped 
resource so you can call a modified bgpio_map() on them in 
bgpio_pdev_probe()) if you find this more elegant. The idea I want to 
convey is that you don't need to rely on the named resources at all times.

Hope this clarifies!

Alex.
