Some comments, but they are really more on the gpio hog. I must have 
missed them.

I can't say I like the term hogs, but that's just cosmetic.

We already have "label" for this purpose.

If they are mutually exclusive, then it should just be one property with 
values. That is much more simple to validate.

But none of this is really even needed. We can do all this with existing 
bindings. Most gpio controllers use 2 cells and the 2nd cell was 
reserved for something like this. Simply adding a -gpios property in the 
gpio controller node would do the job:

init-gpios = <&self n (GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH | GPIO_OUTPUT)>;
hog-gpios = <&self m GPIO_INPUT>;

Perhaps we don't want to use GPIO_ACTIVE_x here, but we have 31 more 
free bits to use.
