What needs to happen (IMHO) is to make gpio_chips properly obeying
the device model, and then add the attributes for fiddling around with
GPIOs to either the *real* device or create a new char device interface=
=2E
Whatever works best. These mock devices are fragile and never
worked properly especially in the removal path as Johans recent
fixes has shown.
