Hi Arnd,

Thanks for your suggestion.

Will do next time.

Yes, this is preferred. Because we don't have MACH_MT8173, so it is
possible a ARM64 + ARCH_MEDIATEK system doesn't need PINCTRL_MT8173, so
we still need 2 slightly different logic. Is it OK if I do this?
Also add some comments so future SoCs can follow the correct template.

# For ARMv7 SoCs
config PINCTRL_MT8135
        bool "Mediatek MT8135 pin control" if COMPILE_TEST && !MACH_MT8135
        default MACH_MT8135
        select PINCTRL_MTK_COMMON

# For ARMv8 SoCs
config PINCTRL_MT8173
        bool "Mediatek MT8173 pin control"
        depends on ARM64 || COMPILE_TEST
        default ARM64
        select PINCTRL_MTK_COMMON
