Forgive me for not turn on plain text mode my last email.

Hi Linus,

My name is Quan Nguyen, I'm working with Y Vo on this patch.

Allow me to explain as below:

In current implementation, gic irq resources were used in both sbgpio
and gpios-key nodes, and this causes confusion.
To avoid this, we introduce sbgpio driver as interrupt controller, it
now provides 6 external irq pins mapped from gpio line 8-13. The
gpio-keys node now uses sbgpio irq resources instead.

How about:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Enable X-Gene standby GPIO driver as interrupt controller, it provides
6 external irq pins via gpio line 8-13.

The SPI40(0x48) through SPI45(0x4D) from GIC are mapped as external
IRQ0 - IRQ5 in this GPIO block, so it is hardware offset not mapped
irq number.

Below is detail:

+ GIC: SPI40 (hwirq=0x48)  <=> SB-GPIO: (hwirq=0) (gpio line 8)
+ GIC: SPI41 (hwirq=0x49)  <=> SB-GPIO: (hwirq=1) (gpio line 9)
...
+ GIC: SPI45 (hwirq=0x4D)  <=> SB-GPIO: (hwirq=5) (gpio line 13)

These defines are to help translating between Gic hardware irq and
SBGPIO hardware irq number.

SBGPIO currently is not capable to mask/unmask/... irqs, so these will
rely on the parent (GIC) instead. To do so, we need keep a parent
domain reference here "struct irq_domain *gic_domain" so we can find
correspond parent irq in runtime.

irq_ack() callback is no-op function in this patch.
