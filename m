Sure I buy this ... just need to push back some to not get too
many deviant DT bindings :/

There is also the code such as of_gpio_simple_xlate()
that can't be reused for this, so thus it needs its own xlate
function and adds some complexity to the code.
But the convention in of_gpio_simple_xlate() is that
cell 0 is offset, and cell 1 is flags, so what about
moving the bank number to the last argument so you
can still use of_gpio_simple_xlate()?

Like so:
gpios = <&gio 5 0 0xD>, <&gio 6 0 0xD>;

I.e. extra cells go at the end. I can see you have a check
hack to see it is hitting a valid GPIO chip by using the label,
but that doesn't seem totally necessary.

Maybe we should even document this as a preferred binding
for "one IP with many banks inside it" use cases so we can
use that going forward?

How typical.

OK.

OK.

Ah I see it has pin multiplexing in front of the GPIO controller
block too. The driver may need  pinctrl_request_gpio()/
pinctrl_free_gpio() etc the day there is a standard pin control
driver in the back end of it. But no hurry with that.

Ah I thought it was register shadows or something,
offsets are OK. Sorry.
