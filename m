I'm an un-fan of GENMASK(). It seems to me to make it less readable.
Unless it's important I'd rather leave the masks as they are because
this is all auto-generated from the hardware design. Also keeping it
in plain form like this makes it easier for people converting
settings from the output of codec tuning tools.
