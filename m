When looking at the crassbar driver it seems to be quite similar to Jerome's
Meson GPIO IRQ driver version. Therefore I think we'd face the same challenges.
What is special about the Meson GPIO IRQ hw:
- We have only 8 parent IRQs for 100+ GPIO's.
- If a GPIO requests IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH (concrete example: mmc sd detection)
  then we have to use two parent IRQs, one for each edge.
- We must be able to dynamically map a GPIO to a parent IRQ, e.g. if a driver
  uses gpiod_to_irq().

These specifics are the reason why I do the mapping magic in the irq_set_type
callback of the irq_chip. Only in this callback I have all the info needed to
do the mapping.

Then I'll submit the latest version with the separated device as v2 and we'll
see which further review comments and suggestions for alternative approaches
come in.
