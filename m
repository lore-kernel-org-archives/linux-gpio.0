Yes, it is an f(chip), but the question that comes to my mind is if
optimization is worth any effort. This is an accessor method over i2c
which tends to be slow (100 / 400kHz SCL) compared to the CPU. So saving
1 or 2 CPU cycles here doesn't seem to be a significant improvement.
Maybe it is more valuable to improve the code path through the i2c core?

BR,
Nikolaus
