I agree.

We have too much standardization burden to maintain already as it is.

And AFAICT the Allwinner support is a hacker/community/enthusiast
effort without vendor backing.

We should be aware that the strong push toward DT standardization
was due to mess in the vendor trees, and as for the ambition to ship
DTBs with products, that is for people producing products to do,
not for the community. Community support can very well use attached
DTB files on the kernel from my point of view, I don't see why
ArchLinuxARM and others should have to standardize and support
DTB file in flash images, very ambitious if they do but definately
not their problem.

Yours,
