Right, that is was I read as well. Let's assume I would be able to patch the 
tables: Would I describe all the logic of this patch in ACPI terms? Where to 
enable interrupts, how to dispatch the SCI event, how to acknowledge it etc.? 
Will it also take care of locking? (BTW, my locking seems to have some remaining 
inconsistency, on second look.)

And even if that were possible, we would be back to the square of existing 
devices without those definitions. If this were a recent chipset, I would say, 
"go, fix future firmware versions". But this one is legacy.
