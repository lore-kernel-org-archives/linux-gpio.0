A problem with that is that the "label" sysfs attribute is not
necessarilly unique (and is even documented as being non unique).
Many drivers just use the chip name as the label so if you have more
than one of them...

Of course if you know the bus and bus address it is possible to find
the associated GPIO base but why should userspace have to know that?
Isn't the whole point of the DT to describe such hardware details?

Doesn't the ability to name GPIOs, fix their direction, and "pre
export" them  in the device tree remove most of the warts of the
current interface? (for GPIOs for which it is used in any case)

While I agree that the sysfs GPIO interface is sometimes abused (such
as for LEDs and switches which already have proper kernel drivers)
there are still cases where a full kernel driver doesn't really make
sense (eg a signal to open a parking barrier) - is anyone suggesting
this needs a custom driver or that the LED one should be used  -
setting the heartbeat trigger on that would be interesting .... :)

Indeed that  doesn't solve the how to export it problem.
AFAICT nothing is visible in sysfs until the export has been done.
