The only forbidding is that it's used from code early at boot, so it has
to be available to the kernel for some of these platforms to function.
Even if it's changed to tristate, the select from these platforms would
force it to be built-in.

gpio-mmio doesn't allow the fixed direction - it assumes that you always
have some form of direction register.  It also doesn't do the double-read
that's necessary for some platforms to get the "current" state of inputs.
It also doesn't do the "use 32-bit accessors even for smaller numbers of
GPIOs".  Lastly, it assumes that the current output state can be read
from the registers - this is not always the case (and is not the case for
Assabet.)

Apart from the missing MODULE_* tags and symbol exports, there's nothing
whic prohibits it becoming a module.

Possibly, but the latter is redundant when used through gpiolib.

Maybe, but I've been told not to put such comments in header files.
I've already spent the last two weeks on this stuff (at the expense
of reading mail), I've not got around to thinking about any kind of
documentation.
