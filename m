I was hoping that the DT schema system would tighten this up, since
there would be specific syntax in the schema to describe all these options.

I was thinking of writing a DT binding review checklist, but so far
haven't made time to do so. It'd probably be reasonable to include any
specific wording requirements for property descriptions in that document.
