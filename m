Aha I see. That's complex. It certainly results in a certain mA drive
strength in the end, but what you're saying is that this is not usually
what we configure.

Do you mean default value as in "whatever the hardware was set
up as at boot time"?

OK I think I get it.

So you say you support this argument and it will be something like

include/dt-bindings/pinctrl/at91.h:#define ATMEL_PIO_DRVSTR_LO  1
include/dt-bindings/pinctrl/at91.h:#define ATMEL_PIO_DRVSTR_ME  2
include/dt-bindings/pinctrl/at91.h:#define ATMEL_PIO_DRVSTR_HI  3

But the definition if generic drive strength is actually in mA.

I think it is OK to deviate from stating it in mA, but you should
write this in the DT bindings so people do not get confused.

But here you know what VDDIOP is, right?

So in debugfs you could actually print the real drive strength
in mA, or both "medium-drive, %u mA"?
