OK I see. Even if you go for the approach I suggest in the cover
letter it is indeed necessary to keep track of the base I
can see, since we span multiple gpio_chips So it's fine with a
local variable for this.

Yeah I kind of think it's a feature because we don't want people
to rely on the static GPIO numbering ;)

Buy OK yeah I see the point. Let's keep the base static for
now.

No, that relies on the internal semantic structure of the
gpiolib. It's better to use .base as a hint then.

Awesome.
