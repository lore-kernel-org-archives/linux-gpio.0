Pretty much agree with Mark here. There is no reason to limit this
naming feature (which I'm not opposed to fundamentally) to the device
tree. Besides gpio_export_with_link() does something suspisciously
similar, and better-suited in my opinion: the GPIO keeps its
hard-coded, predictable name but is also accessible through a link
under the device that uses it. Since GPIOs are typically used as
functions for devices this seems to make the most sense.

But maybe I'm missing your point - could you describe a concrete
use-case for this feature that can *not* be achieved using
gpio_export_with_link()?

Alex.
