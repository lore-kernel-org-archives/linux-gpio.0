In the absence of a BIOS update, how is it expected that the relevant pinctrl
settings for a given device will be known? Does the device provide ACPI
fragments like an SSDT? Does it simply identify itself in some manner, and
leave the rest to the kernel? Is this entirely user-driven?

To be clear, I'm not stating that having pinctrl under the OS is necessarily
wrong, and I can see why the firmware may not have all the relevant knowledge
in advance. I can certainly see why having the OS in control can be preferable.

My concern is that there is a conflict with the ACPI model, and potential
fragility, given that:

* The firmware does not have the relevant information in advance for a given
  device that may be connected (i.e. how devices may change the pinctrl setup
  is unknown).

* The firmware is to some extent expected to manage pinctrl today (for power
  management of devices it does know about), and hence a pinctrl device is
  potentially under shared management of ACPI and the OS.

* The ACPI specification says nothing about this style of pinctrl management,
  so it is unclear what the expectations are:

  - Is a given pinctrl device under shared ownership by the firmware and
    kernel, or is a given device entirely under the control of just one?

  - How shared access to the pinctrl device is mediated, e.g. is any locking or
    signalling mechanism required to ensure that firmware and kernel do not
    access the device simultaneously in a manner that causes problems.

  - Is the firmware permitted to perform power management of devices for which
    the kernel handles pinctrl? What states can either expect, and when is such
    management permitted? e.g. must the OS ensure that a device is in its
    default state? Can it only call power management calls from particular
    states? What is the restored state?

  - What the expectations are w.r.t. ownership of pins, e.g. must the firmware
    never change the state of certain pins? Must it save/restore their state in
    system-wide power-management scenarios like suspend or hibernate?

I think this needs to be raised with the ASWG, and some level of model needs to
be defined for this, to cater for the issues raised above.

That might be very simple, e.g. pins are never shared, the pinctrl management
device must permit concurrent accesses by FW and kernel, the kernel is
responsible for all management of those pins after system reset.

In the absence of that, this is liable to become fragmented and fragile, and is
practically impossible to rectify post-hoc.

I do not disagree that this is expedient. I am concerned that it permits a very
large set of avoidable problems, and I believe that we need to be somewhat
stricter from the outset.

I think that "makes sense for the entire ACPI configuration" needs to be
defined, and then mandated, which implies an ACPI spec addition.

Thanks,
Mark.
