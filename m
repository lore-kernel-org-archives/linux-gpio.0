Hi Arnd,

Per Linus, shall we hold this driver until the GIC submission complete
? Or we will send the version without access GIC to read status in
case the GPIO is configured IRQ ?

+static int xgene_gpio_sb_get(struct gpio_chip *gc, u32 gpio)
+{
+       struct of_mm_gpio_chip *mm_gc = to_of_mm_gpio_chip(gc);
+       struct xgene_gpio_sb *chip = to_xgene_gpio_sb(mm_gc);
+       u32 data;
+
+       data = ioread32(mm_gc->regs + MPA_GPIO_IN_ADDR);
+
+       return (data &  GPIO_MASK(gpio)) ? 1 : 0;
+}

Regards,
Y
