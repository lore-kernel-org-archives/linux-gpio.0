const unsigned int val = value ?  (0x1 << WM5100_GP1_LVL_SHIFT) : 0;

Two lines shorter....

Have you measured the effect of going from int to bool on code size and
speed?  Clearly, the C code is getting longer as '!!' is transformed into
an if-then-else to set a new scratch variable.  But the compiler likely
converts both to a conditional branch or cmov type instruction.  What I
wonder is if converting gpiolib to use bools instead of ints is better just
because someone likes it more that way or if there are objective metrics
that show improvement.

BTW, with a little C algebra:
const unsigned int val = value ?  0x1 << WM5100_GP1_LVL_SHIFT : 0;
const unsigned int val = (value ?  0x1 : 0) << WM5100_GP1_LVL_SHIFT;
const unsigned int val = (!!value) << WM5100_GP1_LVL_SHIFT;  // definition
of ! operator

And now we're back to where we started, so I don't really see why this is
even necessary.  The semantics of the ! operator will be changed in a
future C version?
