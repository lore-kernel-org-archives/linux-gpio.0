I *DON'T* want to mix up the exporting interface with the hogging
mechanism. These have to be two different things and different
patches.

But it looks strange and a bit convoluted. I don't see the point
of the grouping concept. There are ages old mails where I suggest
a very flat mechanism like this:

qe_pio_a: gpio-controller@1400 {
   reg = <0x1400 0x18>;
   gpio-controller;
   #gpio-cells = <2>;
   gpio-hogs-output-high = <15 0>, <12 0>;
   gpio-hogs-output-low = <16 0>;
};

I understand that if you want to give names to the pins that
is maybe a bit terse, then I suggest these named nodes:

qe_pio_a: gpio-controller@1400 {
   reg = <0x1400 0x18>;
   gpio-controller;
   #gpio-cells = <2>;
   {
       gpio-hog-output-high = <15 0>;
       line-name = "foo";
   };
   {
       gpio-hog-output-high = <12 0>;
       line-name = "bar";
   };
   {
       gpio-hog-output-low = <16 0>;
       line-name = "baz";
   };
};

This is pretty straight-forward to parse from the device
tree by just walking over the children of a GPIO controller
node and looking for the hog keywords and optional
line names.

This mechanism can later add some per-pin export
keyword too, if that is desired. But that is a separate
discussion.

Still no need for groups or phandles or stuff like that...

It's a terser version of what I suggested in the last
reply from me:

+               line_b: line_b {
+                       gpio-hog;
+                       gpios = <6 0>;
+                       output-low;
+                       line-name = "foo-bar-gpio";
+               };

Just that I combine gpio-hog, gpios and output-low
into one property.

Any version works, I just don't get this grouping and
phandle business, if such complexity is needed it has
to be motivated.

> This would group all hogs for one controller under a single child node.

Why is that a desireable feature?

I will try to find the other mail thread...
