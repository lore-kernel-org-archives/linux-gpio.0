Formally, it doesn't have to be.

And it doesn't have to be a DSDT, it may be an SSDT too or even a plain
table that's buggy.

At a single table level it is generally difficult to say whether or not
things are going to work.

What needs to work is the namespace which is built from all of the tables
provided combined.  So the namespace needs to be populated first and then
fixes applied on top of that (presumably by deleting, adding or replacing
objects).

Now, in theory, you *may* be able to figure out that combination of tables
A produces namespace B which then will require fix X if the system is Y,
but quite frankly I wouldn't count on that.

Moreover, fixups (or "patches" as I called them, but that wasn't exactly
correct) need to be provided in the form of AML definition blocks to apply on
top of an already populated namespace and if you want to use a binary kernel image,
you can't really afford putting all that stuff for all systems it can possibly
run on into it.  This means that distros need to be able to combine a fixup for
the ACPI tables with the binary kernel and install the result into the system's
boot medium (whatever it is).  Also it should be possible to update the fixup
and the kernel image separately if necessary.

Now from the kernel's perspective that raises the question: "What if the
ACPI tables fixup provided by the distro is not sufficient?"

That needs to be addressed somehow in the code.

So I'm not arguing for that.

In the general-purpose binary kernel image distribution model drivers generally
need to treat information provided by the platform firmware, be it ACPI or a DT
or what-not, as untrusted input that needs to be validated if possible.  That
is not always possible and in those cases we have no choice but to try to use
that information, fingers crossed.  Sometimes we can validate it, though, and
then we should and do something if it turns out to be invalid.

Overall, my view on that is that (1) there needs to be a way for a distro to
provide an ACPI tables fixup for the kernel to apply on top of the already
populated ACPI namespace on a given system and (2) drivers need to be careful
about using firmware data and possibly be able to recover from errors in there.
