Thanks for working on this, but IMHO this cannot go upstream like this,
the gpio pins on the axp pmics need a pinctrl driver, not a gpio
driver. I.E. on the axp209 gpio0 and gpio1 can also be used to output
an additional low-noise ldo (so as a regulator), or as an adc input.

I've been working on gsl1680 touchscreen support lately and on at least
a few a23 tablets, the low-noise ldo is used as AVCC for the touchscreen
controller. Now these use an axp223 pmic, but nothing is stopping
someone from doing something similar with an axp209 and I think it
would be best to support this from day one, rather then hope we can
retro-fit this later without breaking dts.

He he, this matches what I've done in u-boot, the 4th gpio indeed
is somewhat funky (and the docs are not quite clear on how it works
exactly IIRC), leaving it out for now indeed seems for the best.
