I personally think it's fine. If people only want to expose the basic
functionality and can do so with simple-gpio, I don't see any problem at
all with that. (Why should we care that a binding doesn't expose all
features of the device? I'm sure there are many undocumented features,
e.g. debug/backdoor, in HW that we don't even know exist and so don't
know aren't exposed by various bindings)

If someone later finds it useful to expose more functionality than is
sensible to expose through simple-gpio, then a HW-specific binding can
be added for that purpose, and the .dts file amended to use that.

The more I think about this, the more I think that simply having
disjoint simple and HW-specific bindings makes sense.

In that case, the new DT won't be compatible with an old kernel, but I
think that's reasonable, since it was explicitly changed to implement
new features.

I think we should resolve this aspect first before considering the
details. I'm curious what other DT maintainers and users think about
this topic?
