Dear Gregory CLEMENT,

The same can be said of the entire mv78xx0 support in gpio-mvebu: it's
completely unused today. Since the migration to mv78xx0 has not been
started, this platform is still using the old style GPIO driver in
plat-orion/gpio.c. And therefore, all the mv78xx0 specific code in
gpio-mvebu.c is purely "tentative" and has never been actually tested
on HW.

Best regards,

Thomas
