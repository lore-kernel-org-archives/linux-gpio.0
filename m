Yes. It is quite common in SoCs, we just never supported it properly.

Not really. It has special registers just for this purpose,
and the driver is completely unaware that sleep is happening,
instead it is driven to the hardware by special hardware sleep
lines inside the SoC. So it needs to be set up when the default
state is programmed.

No, I've seen it in several hardwares. (The Nomadik pin controller
has this too.)

Yep.
