There are two problem.
1. LPSR IOMUX share input select with IOMUX.
2. If use two instance,  the pin ID will be the same.  If there are a group
mix use LPSR IOMUX and normal IOMUX,  system will be confused.
For example:

UART_pin:
{
          LPSR_IOMUX_RX,
          NORMAL_IOMUX_TX,
}

IOMUX driver don't distinguish it.
