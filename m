Some drivers do this manually, and some use a local pinctrl-ish framework; they're passed big platform data tables with lists of suspend+active GPIO numbers, directions, values and pulls, and then pass those tables back to a library mux-change routine in their suspend/resume handlers.

This observation is correct, and I agree with this reasoning. The PM
states are quite new and may
take some time before they "sink in" in the kernel though, but ideally
people should be using
them like that (atleast IMO).

Well maybe. My point was that it is OK to drive GPIO lines as part of a state
which is only relevant for a device driver, and where using the GPIO API
in top would only bloat and make things hard to follow.

I believe you.

That is even more careful code than most drivers write, so sounds
very nice.

I'd recommend trying to keep as close to the semantics descrived
in <linux/pinctrl/pinconf-generic.h> and not add any implicit semantics.

OK so we solved the similar situation where configs had to be
applied in some certain order for the pin config API by passing
the array of configs down to the driver and let is handle this.

So can we think of an API that gives the drivers the freedom to
express or behave differently here?

We *could* add something like void (* pin_state_commence) ()
to the pinctrl_ops so the driver could cache mux and config ops
and wait for the commence signal before writing anything to the
hardware, and that would be pretty complex.

If it is always the same for every state setting then maybe we
can move this to the core so that we'd add some semantic
flag like

enum state_application_order {
  PINCTRL_ORDER_UNDEFINED,
  PINCTRL_MUX_THEN_CONFIG,
  PINCTRL_CONFIG_THEN_MUX,
};

Then the core needs to alter behaviour on this flag. Any
suggestions welcome, but I won't apply any patches like that
unless there is a driver making use of it.

Yours,
