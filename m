Instead of storing just an array of pinctrl_pin_desc
use the .pins in struct pinctrl_desc and store a pointer
to your struct pinctrl_desc in this state container.

This duplicates names that should already be in the
.pins array in struct pinctrl_desc, don't do that.

Add some comment explaining that you have exactly one group per pin.

You are also re-implementing the .pins field in struct pinctrl_desc
where each pin is described by a struct pinctrl_pin_desc with
special macros available to define them and all.

If you want to have one group per pin named like this
why not just

return pmap->desc->pins[selector].name;

?
