Thanks Linus,

After doing this rework, I noticed that this driver (not the only one though)
assume gpio offset (param of gpio calls) and pin offset are the same thing ...
instead of relying pinctrl (and gpio-ranges) to do the translation.

To make things a bit more clean, I was thinking about forwarding all gpios
framework calls to pinconf, so the gpio to pin offset would go through the
proper mapping function.

Is this the way to do it ?

Using gpio_pinctrl_set_config() I should be able to achieve almost any "write"
functions but I got stuck on gpio_get()

ATM the moment there is no gpio_pinctrl_get_config() or something similar to
read stuff in the gpio framework from pinconf. Would you be open to add
something like this ?
