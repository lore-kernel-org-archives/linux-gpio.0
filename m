There is cases on which particular functional configuration needs sets 
of GPIO to set. On this case, making sub node for each GPIOs creates 
lots of sub-nodes and  add complexity on readability, usability and 
maintainability.
Example: for my board, I wanted to set GPIO H2 to input and H0 and H1 to 
be output high.
Instead of three nodes, I can have two here:
        gpio@0,6000d000 {
                wlan_input {
                        gpio-hog;
                        gpios = <TEGRA_GPIO(H, 2) 0>;
                        input;
                };

                wlan_output {
                        gpio-hog;
                        gpios = <TEGRA_GPIO(H, 0) 0 TEGRA_GPIO(H, 1) 0>;
                        output-high;
                };
        };

So here I am grouping the multiple output GPIO together.

This looks much similar if we have many GPIOs for one type of 
configurations.

Even it looks better if we have something:
        gpio@0,6000d000 {
                wlan_control {
                        gpio-hog;
                        gpios-input = <TEGRA_GPIO(H, 2) 0>;
                        gpios-output-high = <TEGRA_GPIO(H, 0) 0 
TEGRA_GPIO(H, 1) 0>;
                };
        };
