Yeah, I see that I got this wrong when I wrote the driver 4 years ago...

There should be no in-kernel users depending on these numbers being hard
coded, so anyone depending on these numbers starting at 0 would be user
space - doing so incorrectly.

With static numbering of gpios you end up having cross-instance and
cross-driver tweaks to make things fit the number space. In particular
when you combine different gpio chips in different ways for different
devices this becomes a mess.

That's why the idea of static gpio numbering was abandoned a long long
time ago. So while it does solve an immediate problem for you it is
proven not to be the right solution in the long run...
