You are right. We just need some device to bind this driver to. It doesn't 
need to be the wifi driver.

Yes, rfkill is just an interface for userspace to able to control the gpio. 
E.g. backlight of medcom-wide seems to be related to the pwm controller, but 
is not a subnode of it. Instead it is a device of its own without parent. 
Hence, we may include rfkill in a similar, "free-standing" node. But this 
approch was rejected in the past. Maybe this changed now.

Thinking a bit more about it, rfkill is neither a hw block nor a function of 
the wifi driver, so I guess it cannot be added to the usb controller (or a usb 
device).

Anyway, I think this discussion deserves a new mail thread, but I don't have 
enough background information to start one. We can bring this topic back when 
all turkeys who deserve it, are dead.
