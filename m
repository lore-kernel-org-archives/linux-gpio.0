This patch series adds support for the GPIO interrupt controller found
on Amlogic's meson SoC families.

Unlike what the name suggests, this controller is not part of the SoC GPIO
subsystem. It's an indepedent controller which can watch almost all pad of
the SoC and generate and interrupt from it. Some pins, which are not part
of the public datasheet, don't seem to have this capability though.

Hardware wise, the controller is a 256 to 8 multiplexer. It can take up
to 256 input pads and route them to any of 8 GIC's interrupts. There is also
a filter block in the middle to select the appropriate edge or level.

The number of interrupt declared by the irqchip is lowered from 256 to the
actual number of signal routed to the controller on each SoC family. As we
have access to only 8 GIC’s interrupts, these are allocated when an
interrupt is requested from the controller, on a first come, first served
basis.

This series has been tested on Amlogic S905-P200 board with the front
panel power button. Directly passing an IRQ or using gpio_to_irq both work
with this driver.

This work is derived from the previous work of Carlo Caione [1].

Note:
As the comment will explain, patch 10 is not strictly required but would
be an appreciated bonus.
