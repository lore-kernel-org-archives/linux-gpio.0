I think Arnd wanted to remove all the earlyprintk here, just in case
the debug_ll options compiled in the kernel would not match the
board/SoC options.

The indentation looks off here.

It seems like you indented the two first lines with tabs, and the two
last with spaces.

These two looks like generic muxing options, maybe they should be put
