Sure. I will address this in the v2 patch set.

This SoC supports group based configuration and there is a top level register
to select groups. Once the gpio_0_1_pins group is selected, there is one more
register to select between gpio_0_1 and pwm (only four pins). The pins
24 and 25 are shared between nor pins and gpio at the top group level. Once
gpio group is selected, then we can select to be either gpio or pwm. I missed
these two pins to be added to nor_data_pins and will add in the next version.

static const unsigned nor_data_pins[] =  {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
        10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25};

NS2_PIN_GROUP(nand, 0, 0, 31, 1, 0),
NS2_PIN_GROUP(nor_data, 0, 0, 31, 1, 1),
NS2_PIN_GROUP(gpio_0_1, 0, 0, 31, 1, 0),

To select PWM, we need to select gpio and pwm as well.

gpio: gpio {
function = "gpio";
groups = "gpio_0_1_grp";

pwm: pwm {
function = "pwm";
groups = "pwm0_grp", "pwm1_grp";
};

Already available gpio driver "pinctrl-iproc-gpio.c" will be the gpio driver
for this soc as well without pin request.
