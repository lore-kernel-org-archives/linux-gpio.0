Not sure if that's a hardware weirdness or software issue (yet).
Just checked - this goblin is there in 4.0-rc7.

> I don't get the comment above.

The stock u-boot is hacked with a 'failsafe' kernel address.
If for some reason running the 'bootcmd' fails, it reads
5MiBs from partition @ (5d00000 + 0x800) and tries to boot it.
There's no way to change this via environment, only by replacing
the bootloader.
Personally I'm more happy with a simpler partition table, but I
guess upstream should be oriented towards the stock bootloader.
