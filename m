I guess that's what you get for maintaining a subsystem with "general
purpose" in the name ;)

Right, this doesn't match at all with the electrical properties.

What it does give is the nice symmetry with the irq bits and existing
apis for poking and peeking.

The difference with those two cases is that the pieces didn't fit
together, so we tried to use the gpio framework as an adaptor to make it
work.

I picked the gpio framework because:
* the DT nicely represent the structure of the memory and relationship
  between the individual components.

* the implementation needs to be able to set and clear individual bits,
  as well as register handlers for state changes.

* I'm told the SMP2P entries are on some platform (I've never seen)
  actual gpio lines.

I do learn about new helper functions every time I touch these things.

regmap-irq looks good and reasonable.

The problem is that for SMSM I need custom masking operations and on
SMP2P I have multiple regmaps sharing one incoming IRQ. So it doesn't
look applicable for my use cases.

I was expecting some push back from you, but as it was the cleanest
abstraction I would come up with I gave it a shot :)

I'll rewrite the outgoing part based on regmaps instead. Thanks for
reviewing.
