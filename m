That is exactly the situation we have on the CODECs when they go
into runtime suspend, power is removed, and everything is back at
defaults when we resume. Just in our case we re-apply the state
as part of the CODEC resume using a regmap sync.

Apologies if I have missed something here, but does the consumer
not still to some extent need to be aware with this solution
since it needs to re-request the pin state in resume?

I think that is really my only reservation here, is it feels
like this should be something that is purely implemented on the
provider, and be invisible to the consumer, and I am not clear
this is.

It seems quite likely that this property would mostly be
per-provider to me as well.

Thanks,
