Yeah you bet :D

I wrote a lengthy answer to patch 0.

Point being: if we insist on this being modeled as "a kind of GPIO", then
*BSD and Windows also has to think of it as "a kind of GPIO" meaning
we put Linux implementation details into the DT bindings.

At least the idea Rob had about register-bit-* bindings should be respected
see for example:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/register-bit-led.txt

That naming is neutral, even if we end up solving it in Linux with a GPIO
abstraction, it doesn't enforce that on $OTHER_OS.

Yours,
