I'm no expert on this driver, but I wouldn't think there'd be any concurrency
problem if the buffer is only used by the irq handler.
It should never get called concurrently for the same device.

As to the impact, I'll admit I've really got no idea how much potential overhead a
kmalloc has compared to a mutex for the linux kernel.
Just a general rule of thumb, that memory allocations are usually expensive.
