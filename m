I came with one of issue when doing this.

The RTC driver parent is not the same parent for which i2c slave address 
get registered.
There is two slave address from max77620, 0x3C (for general) and 0x68 
for RTC.

In max77620 mfd driver, we make dummy i2c client for 0x68 and initialize 
regmap with this address.

Now on mfd_add_devices, we pass the device for 0x3c and hence the RTC 
driver treat the parent as the 0x3c device but actually it should be 
0x68 to get the proper regmap.


Two approach:
1. If we add the option to pass parent_dev when adding cells form 
mfd_add_devices and select the parent device based on this option then 
it can be easily handle.
     Add parent_dev structure in struct mfd_cell and then change the 
parent in mfd_add_device() if cells has parent device.

2. Register the RTC driver with different mfd_add_devices with dummy i2c 
client device.
So two times mfd_add_devices.


IMO, approach 1 looks good to me.

Any opinion?
