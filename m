Right, the chips are used in a broader space but in cases where they're
being used in fixed systems where we don't have to deal with repaceable
modules then the idiomatic thing for ACPI is to hide all the pinmuxing
=66rom the operating system.

Yup, they do.

Yes, funnily enough the CHIP people were just talking about that
specific case at ELC yesterday (they patched u-boot to parse overlays
so the kernel never sees the hotplug).

That's what people are doing with the BeagleBone/RPi/CHIP/96boards case
- it's one of the primary usecases for DT overlays but currently
everyone's final integration layer is out of tree.

Yup, will reply there.
