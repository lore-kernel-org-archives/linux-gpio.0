Only 4 GPIO pins are pin configurable. The other GPIO pins are group
controlled as mentioned in the NS2_PIN_GROUP. A single gpio request will affect
the other pins in that particular group as the control is available
to select either "gpio group" or the other. As shown below

0x00 selects "gpio_6_7_pins" together
0x01 selects "pcie_a3_clk_wak_pins"
0x02 selects "nor_addr_4_5_pins"

static const unsigned gpio_6_7_pins[] = {31, 32};
static const unsigned pcie_a3_clk_wak_pins[] = {31, 32};
static const unsigned nor_addr_4_5_pins[] = {31, 32};

I tested with not providing the "ranges" property in the gpio node. The
"iproc_gpio_request" and "iproc_gpio_free" functions returned back as
"rages" property is not defined.

        if (!chip->pinmux_is_supported)
                return 0;

We can support the "iproc_gpio_request" and "iproc_gpio_free" functions for the
4 gpios that share the pwm pins only. Please suggest me here.

Thanks,
Dhananjay
