I can't say I'm a fan. It seems rather clumsy and ad-hoc - though I do
see how it matches the code you replace in drivers/gpio/. When I
initially read the cover letter, I assumed that one would get a sequence
of 4-bit values, but one has to dig the actual value out of the bitmap
afterwards using all of index, offset and a mask computed from clump_size.

That's a rather inconvenient unit, no? And rather easy to get wrong, I
can easily see people passing nbits instead.

I think you could reduce the number of arguments to this helper and the
macro, while getting rid of some confusion: Drop index and offset, let
clump_index be start_index and measured in bit positions (like
find_next_bit et al), and let the return value also be a bit position.
And instead of index and offset, have another unsigned long* output
parameter that gives the actual value at [return value:return
value+clump_size]. IOW, I think the prototype should be close to
find_next_bit, except that in case of "clumps", there's an extra piece
of information to return.

The cover letter says

  The clump_size argument can be an arbitrary number of bits and is not
  required to be a multiple of 2.

by which I assume you mean "power of 2", but either way, the above code
does not seem to take into account the case where bits_offset +
clump_size straddles a word boundary, so it wouldn't work for a
clump_size that does not divide BITS_PER_LONG.

May I suggest another approach:

unsigned long bitmap_get_value(const unsigned long *bitmap, unsigned
start, unsigned width): Get the value of bitmap[start:start+width] for
1<=width<=BITS_PER_LONG (it's up to the caller to ensure this is within
the defined region). That can almost be an inline

bitmap_get_value(const unsigned long *bitmap, unsigned start, unsigned
width)
{
  unsigned idx = BIT_WORD(start);
  unsigned offset = start % BITS_PER_LONG;
  unsigned long lower = bitmap[idx] >> offset;
  unsigned long upper = offset <= BITS_PER_LONG - width ? 0 :
bitmap[idx+1] << (BITS_PER_LONG - offset);
  return (lower | upper) & GENMASK(width-1, 0)
}

Then you can implement the for_each_set_clump by a (IMO) more readable

  for (i = 0, start = 0; i < num_ports; i++, start += gpio_reg_size) {
    word_mask = bitmap_get_value(mask, start, gpio_reg_size);
    if (!word_mask)
      continue;
    ...
  }

Or, if you do want find_next_clump/for_each_set_clump, that can be
implemented in terms of this.
