If you consider that you are defining the available functions for this
pinmuxer and then define the sets of pins exposing these available
functions it does make sense to just name it "qpic".

I think that naming them _common, _lcd and _nand is just adding
confusion when it comes to writing the dts files.


@Linus, do you have a different preference here?
