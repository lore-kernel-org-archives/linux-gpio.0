I have no objections to have a simplier macro for these common clump
sizes -- afterall, I suspect most drivers will likely use clump sizes
that are powers of 2 anyway. It would be nice to have a more versatile
macro though for those drivers that would benefit from odd clump sizes,
but we can perhaps postpone that until the need arises (the GPIO drivers
in this patchset all use a power of 2).
