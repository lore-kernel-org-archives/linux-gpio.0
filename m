The intention here is to tell the pinctrl core code that a pinctrl
provider hardware will lose its hardware state upon entering a system
wide deep sleep. This is mainly because this specific pinctrl provider
is no an ON/OFF power island that is powered off on suspend, and resumes
with its default pin state.

Your patch does seem to be tackling a different angle indeed.

As you may see, the problem in my case is that the hardware has only onw
pinctrl state: "default", and it loses its hardware register contents,
and because of early check in pinctrl_select_state(), we do nothing (the
state has not changed per-se), so we are left with SW thinking we
applied the "default" state again, while in fact we did not.

The approach taken here was to move this to the core pinctrl code
because this is not something a pinctrl consumer should be aware of,
when it calls pinctrl_select_state(), it should do what it asked for.

I also decided to make this a per-provider property as opposed to a
per-group property because chances are that the state retention is on a
per-controller basis, and not per-bank/group, although I may be wrong.
