That's exactly my question was in my first email. It's ok.

What is your openion on overall code changes for regmap support ?
Any other feedback or suggestions?

The issue I have here with the signature of read/write fn

static unsigned __maybe_unused pcs_read(void __iomem *reg)
static void __maybe_unused pcs_writeX(unsigned val, void __iomem *reg)


For regmap, I need 2 arguments,

1. Pointer to regmap
2. Offset to register


So I will have to change the signature to

static unsigned __maybe_unused pcs_read(void __iomem *reg, unsigned int 
offset)
static void __maybe_unused pcs_write(void __iomem *reg, unsigned val, 
unsigned int offset)


And,
On the same direction, will having separate functions for regmap.

static unsigned pcs_read_regmap(void __iomem *reg, unsigned int offset)
{
	unsigned int val;

	regmap_read((struct regmap *)reg, offset, &val);
}

static void pcs_write_regmap(void __iomem *reg, unsigned val, unsigned 
int offset)
{
        regmap_write((struct regmap *)reg, offset, val);
  }


This functions will be initialized to pcs_device->read/write.

I will have to do some more changes, specially around pcs_interrupt
usage.
