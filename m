The purpose of the spi-gpio driver is to avoid having to write
two drivers for every spi slave device if someone wants to drive
it using bit-banged gpios.

The existing users of the driver are in fact all using spi-gpio,
see:
arch/arm/boot/dts/armada-xp-lenovo-ix4-300d.dts
arch/arm/boot/dts/imx28-cfa10049.dts

and in openwrt:
target/linux/brcm63xx/patches-3.14/501-board-NB4.patch
target/linux/brcm63xx/patches-3.14/526-board_CT6373-1.patch

so there shouldn't be too much missing, and extending spi-gpio
for any missing features would help other people trying to attach
random spi devices using gpio as well.
