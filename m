Right, I didn't notice PATCH 2 was from Linus because it didn't have
his Signed-off-by but yours (although now I notice that it was sent
with him as the author).

AFAIK you can still squash both patches and in that case the
convention is to add the original author s-o-b and then explain your
contributions on top. i.e:

From: Linus Walleij <linus.walleij@linaro.org>

This switches the SiRF pinctrl driver over to using the gpiolib
irqchip helpers simplifying some of the code.

[Baohua.Song@csr.com: move to use irq_get_handler_data]
Signed-off-by: Linus Walleij <linus.walleij@linaro.org>

But it's also OK to have split in two patches, I just asked out of curiosity :-)

Best regards,
Javier
