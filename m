The meson pinctrl driver is designed so that, the pad numbering (or the
equivalent), is linear within a bank. This makes the code simpler for a
lot of things in the meson-pinctrl driver (like finding the appropriate
register and bit). Because of this, and the fact that some gpio might
not have an irq, pad == hwirq cannot hold.

In addition the pad numbering starts from 0 on each gpiochip.

The solution for that is to have the first and last irq number (which
is actually the mux setting of the controller) in the data of each gpio
bank, as described in the Datasheet.

That's the way the meson pinctrl driver works (linear numbering in each
banks) and the HW is described in DS. Why would it be dangerous ?

Linus, please correct me if I'm wrong,
.to_irq gets the linux gpio number and returns the linux virtual irq
numbers, 0 if there is no interrupt.

So could either find or create the mapping.
   A. With the hardware at hand, and the limited upstream interrupt
      number, i don't see how we could create the mapping beforehand.
