I just get the impression that DT support for DaVinci in v3.14 is so risky
and unstable that noone except those implementing it (i.e. you) is really
using it, is that correct?

In that case it is hardly a fix that we need to rush out to the entire world.

But if you have bug reports from DaVinci developers doing advanced DT
stuff and scratching their heads, then we can push this to fixes.
