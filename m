Hi,

(adding linux-sunxi, which I forgot at the initial post).

But this is just *data*, and I believe it is actually package specific.
We need the DT to describe the relation between devices and pins anyway,
it's just that we use arbitrary strings today instead of the actual
register value. This is what the generic pinmux property fixes.

Yes, my DeLorean is in the garage, so I can't really change this anymore
;-) But that doesn't mean we have to go on with this forever, I think.

I don't get what the driver would need to validate? We rely on DT
information to be correct anyway, otherwise your board just won't work.
If the DT is wrong, you have much bigger problems.

Actually we gain something, because we only commit information that can
actually be tested. Right now we have a lot of information which is
copied from the manual, and nobody knows if pin H24 on the A10 is really
PATA-CS1 or not. Plus we have bugs when creating the table, plus
copy&paste bugs. I found some while grep-ing for patterns - will send
fixes ASAP.

In the moment all the table gives us is a mapping between a *string* and
the respective mux register value (per pin), plus the number of pins in
each bank. This can *easily* be put in the DT and should belong there.

Actually I believe that the current binding is not correct, because it
makes those mux strings a part of the binding, though this is not
documented anywhere. A developer cannot take the binding and write a
working driver or even a DT without looking at the code.
Plus we already changed those names in the past (for instance commit
bc0f566a98c4), basically breaking compatibility.

We stop adding tables with SoC specific *data* in the kernel *code*
base. With being boolean Kconfig options, this gets added to every
single-image kernel.

More important: those tables help Linux, but other DT consumers (*BSD,
U-Boot) have to replicate them, which is just wrong, IMHO.

I believe the kernel is a nice collection of really good code for
complicated file systems, high performance network protocols and
sophisticated memory management, among others. It shouldn't be a dumping
ground for arbitrary, very SoC specific information. Cf. LinusT 2011.
DT is out there to fix this, so we should do so.

Cheers,
Andre.
