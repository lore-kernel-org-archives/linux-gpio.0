To be fully honest I'm a bit annoyed with the pinctrl framework making
things (IMHO) unnecessarily complex, for what is basically a pretty
easy task. But I'll try to keep things focused on the technical issue
at hand, so we can all make some progress.

Neither. Pengutronix is mostly contracted by customers of NXP to enable
stuff in mainline. So I'm not working on this in my spare time, but I
still have to deal with the fact that I can only get the information
from the reference manual, NXP downstream BSPs and the occasional
helpful NXP employee.

Also even if we were inside of NXP, pad cells are usually something
that chip makers buy or get from the Fab design library. So probably
even they don't know what's inside exactly.

Semiconductor physics tends to be slightly more complex than this. :)

Interesting indeed, but pretty far away from the dt-binding we set out
to discuss. And even if we might come up with a simplistic model of
what's going on inside the pad cell, how do we know if it matches
reality? Does this really help us define a useful binding?

What usually happens is that hardware (I'm talking about board/system
here) designers start by reading the reference manual and hardware
design guide and work with that. They come up with all the necessary
configuration in the terms of the manual.

After that they or someone else has to translate this into DT. Things
get confusing when the reference manual and the DT binding disagree
about the used terms.

I wasn't referring to the chip design people, but board designers. I
talk to them quite often, but it's a lot easier if the Linux people and
board designers agree on the terms used. :)

I'm not keen on using the common padctrl stuff, which already bloats
the DT description compared to i.MX6, and then again need to introduce
custom properties. That's just worst of both worlds, verbose DT to use
the common stuff, mixed with special properties, only valid on this
single controller.

If you insist I guess I'm fine with compromising on an "output-
impedance" common property, but then this just makes things harder for
everyone involved, as the impedance even seems to vary slightly with
the used pad voltage. So to not get into a combinatorial explosion, we
would need to describe this property as somethings like "output
impedance at 3.3v)", at least on this specific hardware.

Or we could agree that drive-strength property could be described in
some unit that makes sense on each controller. mA for hardware
described with some fabled ideal load matching, Ohms for hardware that
models it this way with maximum drive strength at the point of best
load matching.

In the end this is about mapping 3 hardware bits to a DT description...
