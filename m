This works for platform drivers which stay confined to the kernel, but
DT is a firmware definition where such generic bindings are much less
desirable.

Here your compatible string should be

        compatible =3D "brcm,brcm6368", "basic-mmio-gpio";

I.e. from more precise to less precise. A dedicated BRCM6368 driver
should take precedence over your generic one.

I understand the intent but IIUC the history of DT speaks  against
such generic bindings. On the other hand I can see some instances of
them like "simple-bus" for instance. Added the DT maintainers and
mailing list to get more informed opinions on the matter.
