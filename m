You cannot. The muxing fails because you request a function that is
not in the table for that pin - as opposed to muxing some other random
function on the pin silently.

The function string is needed for the setting to make any sense.

As you have pointed out yourself the function name may resolve to
different muxval for different pins.

You need those SoC pin tables so you know what you multiplexed to
what. They are in the kernel where they IMHO belong. Not having them
at all is a no-go because then you have no idea what functions you
have enabled on the SoC.

What you suggest is adding duplicate lower level information in the DT
so higher level pinmux driver uses symbolic function name and lower
level driver using raw mux number. This means that maintenance
problems increase with these low level and high level pin mux
descriptions potentially going out of sync in the DT.

We cannot get rid of it. And really, the assembly is the same for all
the SoCs. It's the machine code which isn't and which the assembly
abstracts.

Except as has been pointed out in DT unused features are not to be
included so you would lose the functions which are included in the
in-kernel tables but are not wired on any supported board.

Also the uart0_pins_a part is just trashed AFAIK so once the kernel
boots you have no idea what pins you got in the driver. So if the low
level pinmux driver were to replace the high level pinmux driver it
would have to parse the pin tables in the DT and reconstruct the
currently hardcoded pin tables from the DT information so that when
you look at the pinmux state later you know what it means without the
in-kernel hardcoded table. Then all pinmux values are technically used
by the pinmux driver to reconstruct the pinmux table and should be
included in the DT.

No. You can just include the pin table in the C code as opposed to
linking in a DT parser as well as requiring heap space to parse the
DT.

well, you can always cut and paste the data from DT to any code you
want, anyway. So long as you do have the data somewhere.

Thanks
