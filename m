The idea with GPIO numbers is not that these shall correspond
to schematics or data sheets or anything like that. It's a completely
Linux-internal number and has nothing to do with anything else.

The same is true for IRQ numbers.

The long term goal is to get rid of both GPIO and IRQ numbers
and deal only with descriptors in the kernel.

A patch to add the device tree bindings is *very* welcome.

I do not like a patch that changes the dynamic numbering to a
static one, that make things worse for our goals, not better :-(
