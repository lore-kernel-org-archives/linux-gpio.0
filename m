Yup.

The way stuff is usually forced ordered in device tree is to use
aliases, e.g.:

        aliases {
                serial0 = &pb1176_serial0;
                serial1 = &pb1176_serial1;
                serial2 = &pb1176_serial2;
                serial3 = &pb1176_serial3;
                serial4 = &fpga_serial;
        };

By getting the alias ID with of_alias_get_id(np, "serial")
a certain serial port is assigned to be
0, 1, 2 ...

I think I could accept a tweak of this patch that will register
GPIOs beginning from 0 if and only if the alias mechanism is
used.

        aliases {
                gpio0 = &foo_gpio0;
                gpio1 = &expander;
        };


The actual Linux-specific integer base will *NOT* be in the
device tree, but if you know how many GPIOs are on each
controller the number space is still stable and predictable
beginning from 0. If one want to keep track of the Linux
number space one can do so with comments in the device
tree or something.

What do you think about the above?
