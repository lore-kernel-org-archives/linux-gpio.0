I still think this is the wrong thing to do. You are hiding magic values
in the driver, for no good reason. If ACPI has such a broken model that
it cannot give you the various parameters you need, then this is an ACPI
problem you can solve in the ACPI-specific code. Alternatively, you
could also fix your ACPI tables to be less braindead.

But please do not turn the DT code into the same mess for the sake of
using the lowest common denominator. Have a set of properties describing
the HW, a compatibility string to nicely identify the revision, and use
that. You can still hardcode things for ACPI if you desperately need it.

Thanks,

	M.
