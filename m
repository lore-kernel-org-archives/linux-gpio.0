That wording does seem better, will change.

I was wondering about that.  Some bindings have them listed, some
don't.  In this case I know what names currently exist but there could
certainly be different ones in the future.  How does that work?  Or am
I misunderstanding what this field is used for?  Where are the
documented rules for this?

Sure.

OK.

This is the output that we actually get from the bootloader.  But
regardless, IMO the example should have both cases: precedence is
well-defined, both sets of information are valid, and the driver can
handle the case where interrupts-extended is not an understood
property.

Thanks for the review,
