Here is more hardware detail. Will add it to document later.

Hardware has two register regions to control pinmux, one is for normal
function configuration and the other one is for always on subsystem(AON).
Some pins are controlled by both normal register and AON register, while
some pins are controlled only by normal register. That means some pins
are hierarchical, AON register is the 1st level control for pinmux. If
we need any function in normal register pin multiplexing, we need configure
related AON pinmux register to non-AON function first. Then we configure
normal pinmux register to get the pin function we want. For those pins
that are not controlled by AON registers, we just need to configure normal
pinmux register for function multiplexing.

All pin configuration, such as pull up/down, is controlled by registers
in AON register region, which is layouted just after AON pinmux registers.
So we need access AON register region even we are configuring normal
pins which has no AON pin multiplex functions.

Thanks for pointing the usage of  regs =3D <a b>, <c d>;
For normal pinmux function, we still need AON registers for pin
configuration, maybe
this is what you care.

Yes, the two arrangements are clearer to show the parent relation.
