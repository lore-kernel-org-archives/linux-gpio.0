I reviewed up to patch 39. There are too many files on x86 that seems
to be mangled by some tab->whitespace conversion, with caused
very big diffs and lots of broken ascii artwork.

Please ensure that the diffs will contain the minimal amount of stuff
that would be required for them to be properly formatted as ReST
files there.

Ah, perhaps next time you could format the patches with a lower
merge similarity logic (using, for example, the parameter -M10).
