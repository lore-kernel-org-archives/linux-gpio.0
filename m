Again, I'm not really worried about this driver, but the ACPI tables. How
does the difference show there?

The outputs (s_enable, s_idle and s_resetn) are not numbered in the
documentation. There grouped, though, but the order in that grouping varies.

This information should come from the ACPI tables, it should not be present
in drivers. Why do you need it?

If that was the case, I bet you could expect interesting behaviour from the
hardware connected to these pins.

For what it's worth, the chip documentation states that the reset value for
the SGPO and GPDO registers is zero, as well as that GPIOs are configured as
input and the reset value of the s_* outputs is low.

In other words, I don't think that explicitly setting the values to zero has
an effect.
