I foresee many problems if people start using gpiod_array_get() as a
way to spare a few lines of error-checking code. First all the GPIOs
would end into an array instead of members with meaningful names -
unless they are moved later on, but doing so would add extra code and
somewhat kill the purpose. It also becomes more difficult to maintain
as you are dealing with array indexes to update all over the code.
Finally, it will make it more difficult to use gpiod_array_*() the way
it is intended to be used, as you would have to discriminate between
GPIOs of the same function and the rest by yourself.

Also, if such a convenience function is legitimate for GPIO, shouldn't
it also apply to other sub-systems? E.g. regulator_array_get()?

Maybe I am missing your point, but I still think some error-handling
code really doesn't hurt here, and the few drivers that would actually
benefit from a more automated GPIO request error handling can easily
implement it themselves. Let's keep gpiod_array_*() single-purposed
and to the point.
