I was waiting on Andy to suggest some examples out of the GPIO realm,
but he may be under a heavy workload right so I decided to do a quick
search for one.

In drivers/of/unittest.c, there is loop across a bitmap in the
of_unittest_destroy_tracked_overlays function:

	for (id = MAX_UNITTEST_OVERLAYS - 1; id >= 0; id--) {
		if (!(overlay_id_bits[BIT_WORD(id)] & BIT_MASK(id)))
			continue;

This section of code is checking each bit individually, and skipping if
that bit is not set. This looping can be optimized by using the
for_each_set_clump8 macro to skip clumps of nonset bits (not to mention
make the logic of the code much simpler and easier to follow by reducing
the code to a single line):

	for_each_set_clump8(id, clump, overlay_id_bits, MAX_UNITTEST_OVERLAYS-1)

The for_each_set_clump8 macro is not specific to the GPIO subsystem; I
just happen to use it in these GPIO drivers simply because I am most
familar with this section of the kernel (it's where most of my
contributions occur afterall).

Consider this, if I am able to find a use for this macro outside of the
GPIO subsystem within a matter minutes, then there must be some benefit
in allowing the rest of the kernel to use the for_each_set_clump8 macro.
So let's put it in bitops.h rather than restrict it to just the GPIO
subsystem.
