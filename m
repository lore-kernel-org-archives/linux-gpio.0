Either the driver is MFD is the PMIC or it's not.

If it is, the compatible should reflect that, if isn't not then the
description in the header comment and the one above is not correct.

IMO, 'pmic' should not be used in the regulator compatible strings, as
it's a general description of the overall device.  The regulators are
just a component of that device.
