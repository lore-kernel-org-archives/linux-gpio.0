For sound/soc.h, the member is indeed public but I don't see it being
used to pass descriptors around between drivers.

For linux/leds.h, I think this is the reason why we introduced
devm_get_gpiod_from_child()

These looks more like a bad usage of GPIO descriptors, but AFAICT they
can be fixed by fixing the drivers and, by all means, this is where we
should do it.

This is a different situation from yours where we are trying to deal
with broken firmware and need to resort to tricks at one point or the
other.

Or am I missing your point?
