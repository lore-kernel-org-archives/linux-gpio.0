I think the binding needs to be adjusted -- syscon has nothing to do with
the binding, that's a Linux construct.

Really, if this is rephrased it becomes much more clear that this is a useful
driver:

CLPS711X implements a few GPIO lines in a register area that is shared with
other system registers. This is a driver for those GPIO lines, implemented
using the shared syscon infrastructure in the kernel.

And then take out syscon from the name of the driver (and the binding).

If we have more drivers like these down the road we can make a common shared
binding, but until then I don't think there's much point in it.
