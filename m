I think that was just the header file inclusion, but no actual ACPI
support. Al Stone is experimenting with ACPI support for X-Gene, and
some earlier patches from APM had rudimentary support as well, but
we are not adding ACPI support to X-Gene drivers upstream until we
know whether we can support the entire platform in that mode or not.

Just DT at the moment.

See the discussion I had on this. Yes, each line is connected to a
GIC SPI interrupt by itself. I've discussed this with Marc Zyngier
and Thomas Gleixner at the conference last week, and we concluded
that we will need a new generic interface to get data out of the
parent interrupt controller in a proper way. The current implementation
just maps the GIC registers and reads them directly, which of course
is not a proper way to do it.
