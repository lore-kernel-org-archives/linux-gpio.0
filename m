So, it means to spread IDs in two places. Looking into silead_dmi.c I
can say it looks as a hack, we aren't supposed to use "ACPIXXXX:YY" in
the drivers AFAIK. Besides the fact of notifier and arch_initcall().

It indeed feels like a crap and looks like a crap.

Rafael, Mika, what are your opinions about proposed approach?

It works due to luck, not otherwise.
