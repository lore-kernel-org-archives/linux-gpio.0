Hi Brian!

Thanks for this patch!

Done like so:

This creates a problem and makes my kernel crash, because
handle_edge_irq() *unconditionally* calls chip->irq_ack(),
and since this chip does not implement .irq_ack(), it crashes.

I tried to just add a void .irq_ack(). That instead made the
kernel hang.

If I just assign handle_level_irq() as before (just replaced
all assignments of handle_edge_irq with handle_level_irq)
it boots nicely, AND the interrupts are working fine on the
ADC calibration path, and further readings of the ADC
generates new IRQs, as expected!

The handle_edge_irq and .irq_ack() call path is for hardware
that require an explicit ACK (such as writing a bit in some
register) when handling edge IRQs. This is necessary in some
hardware because of the transient nature of edge IRQs.
This is not necessary on some hardware that will simply
clear the flag when something is reading the status register.
I think this is the case with PM8xxx and you can safely use
handle_level_irq with all IRQs. It looks counterintuitive and
maybe the function handle_edge_irq() has a stupid name.
Just drop this handle_edge_irq() business for now.

This was tested on the APQ8060 DragonBoard.

However this happens:

[    3.052485] smsc911x 1b800000.ethernet-ebi2: ignoring dependency

But I think that is because these all use ssbi-gpio interrupts and
these are now handled properly so I will try to fix the device
tree and send a separate patch that you can include.

Yours,
