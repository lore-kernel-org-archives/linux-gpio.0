I know it's in the common binding, but it's going to be very hard to
support. The drive-strength in mA really depends on external loading of
the pin and the pin voltage, at least for the most widespread
controllers that only switch between resistors, instead of driving the
pin by a current regulator.
So we would need much more information, which doesn't really seem
practical.

I would much prefer if we just remove unit from the common binding and
let the drivers define it in a way that fits their hardware
description.

It's the same thing with the slew-rate really, but the common binding
didn't make the mistake to define a single unit there, with many
pincontrollers being really vague about how fast the slew really is,
but some may actually define it in uS or whatever else makes sense.
