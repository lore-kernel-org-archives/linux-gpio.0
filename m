Yeah, I agreed that by declaring the cygnus_pins array const, it makes
it more obvious that "we do not expect any of its parameters to change."
But later if we cast &gpio_mux to void * before assigned to drv_data of
pinctrl_pin_desc, we sort of break it up...I'll keep this part of code
as it is for now.

Thanks,
