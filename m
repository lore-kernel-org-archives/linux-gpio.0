Kevin, what SoC do you use ? The GPIO+pinmux hardware architecture varies 
between models (with a single driver handling both GPIO and pinmux versus two 
separate drivers), I'd like to know the exact target before replying to your 
questions below.

By the way, Kevin, feel free to CC linux-sh@vger.kernel.org on Renesas-related 
topics.

The legacy API used fake GPIOs for pinmux and pinconf. We don't really need to 
care about it, but we need to ensure that that pinctrl API covers all the use 
cases.

I'll reply to the rest of the e-mail as soon as Kevin gives me the SoC model 
he's using.
