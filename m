IRQ domains are Linuxisums, which aren't allowed in DT.

I'd prefer something along the lines of:

  "Identifies the node as an interrupt controller."

Just grep for #interrupt-cells in Documentation.  There are plenty of
nice, short examples.

"This device controls platform power" or something.

I wouldn't describe any of them.  It's normally pretty obvious which
properties are boolean by the lack of required cell description.

There are lots of ways you can solve this and so many examples of
others doing so.  I suggest you have a look at some DTS files and
figure it out.  One possible solution is to use different compatible
strings.

This is exactly how you need to think.  Reducing the number of
properties you introduce (and this device adds a lot more than I would
normally expect by the way) needs to be top priority.

Yes, that way you have each of the the subsystem experts review your
documentation.  You can then link to them from this document.
