That is very much how I feel about things anyways.
In a recent presentation:
https://dflund.se/~triad/papers/GPIO-for-Engineers-and-Makers.pdf

I had the following text:

The Rules of Linux Userspace GPIO
1. You do not access GPIOs from userspace
2. YOU DO NOT ACCESS GPIOS FROM USERSPACE
3. Read Documentation/gpio/drivers-on-gpio.txt
4. Use the character device

People do need to access GPIOs from userspace for things
like one-off makerspace projects, relays on factory lines,
fire alarms, door openers etc etc.

One-off projects is fine, the user likely has an idea about the
whole system that is comprehensive. They use the random
raspberry Pi (etc) development board for this. OK.

When we are talking about adding GPIO in mass-market goods
such as phones and tablets and laptops userspace GPIO
access become more and more dubious.
