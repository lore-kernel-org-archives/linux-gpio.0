Linus, Marc,

The calculation is question here is meant to get the appropriate hwirq
number from a particular gpio (and deal with the gpios that can't
provide an irq at all). 

If I look at other gpio drivers, many are doing exactly this kind of
calculation before calling 'irq_create_mapping' in the to_irq callback.
For example:
- pinctrl/nomadik/pinctrl-abx500.c
- pinctrl/samsung/pinctrl-exynos5440.c

Some can afford to create all the mappings in the probe and just call
'irq_find_mapping' (gpio/gpio_tegra.c) but this would not work here. We
have only 8 upstream irqs for 130+ pins, so only 8 mappings possible at
a time. 

My understanding is that irqdomain provide a way to map hwirq to linux
virq (and back), not map gpio number to hwirq, right?

Even if I implement an another irqdomain at the gpio level, I would
still have to perform this kind of calculation, one way or the other.

Actually this discussion go me thinking about another issue we have
with this hardware.
We are looking for a way to implement support for IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH
(needed for things like gpio-keys or mmc card detect). 
The controller can do each edge but not both at the same time.
I'm thinking that implementing another irqdomain at the gpio level
would allow to properly check the pad level in the EOI callback then
set the next expected edge type accordingly (using
'irq_chip_set_type_parent')

Would it be acceptable ?

It looks a few other drivers deal with IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH in a similar
way (gpio/gpio-omap.c, gpio/gpio-dwapb.c)
