I don't think that's true in a general way. This "pinmux" is already an
accepted property and used for exactly that purpose in other pinctrl
drivers:
$ git grep -l '[^,]pinmux = ' arch/arm{,64}/boot/dts
Plus the fsl,pinmux-ids property, which seems to serve the same purpose.

I know, but that does not mean that I need to like it or should avoid
finding better solutions.

I think you got me wrong, I am totally not arguing ABI stability and its
consequences. That's why this binding is mostly for newer SoCs, but also
designed to stay compatible with the old binding - that's for other DT
users. Of course we need to keep the tables in the kernel.

But it's not a *user* ABI, where unprivileged users can supply input data.
What else can you rely on then if not on the DT?
By definition you can't be able to validate every bit of it. How would
you know that the reg address of that SATA chip is correct and not
actually pointing to the "set-board-on-fire" device?
And what about those regulators, where it gives you the allowed voltage
range?

If you can change the DT, you already have full control over the system.
Ideally the DT comes as part of the firmware, so if you control this,
there are far less complicated ways to burn down the system. And even if
you supply the DT with your kernel, you must have control and could
trigger the set-fire device via /dev/mem or the like.

When does a *user* write a device tree? What would a clueless Joe
Average expect from doing so? The device tree is written by either the
board/SoC vendor or by some kernel developers. It is not meant to be
changed by the user, apart from carefully crafted overlays, maybe. You
can have the same control by just changing the kernel (binary patching
the image file or re-compiling with
writel(MATCHES, base_addr + SET_FIRE)).

> What if one of the settings causes the board to go up in flames?

Then you better not play with it. But I don't think this is a valid
argument, really. What if gravity reverses tomorrow?
Are there any known issues with writing mux values to pinctrl registers?
I don't think the consequences would be different from putting low or
high to a GPIO, which you can do already from userland.

Yes, but at the moment we can't test all of the settings we put in the
kernel table. Some pins are for devices for which we don't have drivers
in the kernel (yet), for some we probably never will (JTAG).

I don't see how a DT is more risky. Conceptually I consider the DT being
part of the firmware, so one trust level above the kernel. I understand
that some people have different experiences with "firmware", but frankly
I believe this discussion is pointless. If you get the DT wrong, your
board won't work. If the system easily allows you to destroy it by means
of software, you might want to fix it in general, for instance by
telling firmware to not allow access to it from the kernel. Or by
designing hardware in a way that you don't need to expose critical
settings to software. That how x86 solves most of it and what makes it
hard to physically kill a rented root server.
Hiding stuff from the DT and putting molly guards in the kernel does not
really solve this problem.

Exactly, and that does not change on the *board* level, because there we
just refer to the pinctrl subnode phandles, defined in <soc>.dtsi.
And it's just there that I want to add the right pinmux value.

I think this is a misunderstanding. As mentioned above I never proposed
to remove the tables from the kernel. I think I said this explicitly in
several places:

I totally understand the concept of compatibility, ask Maxime, he hates
me for that ;-)

Yes, but together with the hardware docs you should be able to write a
driver. And here you can't, because you are missing the strings. So a
BSD developer has to look at Linux code.
Sure you can go ahead and add those strings to the binding, but I wonder
how complicated it has to get until we just go with the obviously
simplest way and just add this innocent mux value to the DT.

But how much of this is SoC specific configuration data? How much is it
in x86? Yes, historically we had and have a lot of configuration data in
ARM kernels. But that doesn't mean that we have to continue with this or
even increase the share.

I don't get what's the point of duplicating this information everywhere.
We already have places in the DT to put this information:
	function = "uart1";
So we add "pinmux = <2>" *once* to *the* DT, and everyone gets this for
free. If U-Boot wants to enable MMC0, it just follows the phandle from
pinctrl-0 and writes the value(s) from "pinmux" to the registers derived
from the member of the "pins" string list. No SoC knowledge required.

I know, I did this before. But currently you have to write both the DT
part *and* the kernel table. And check patch 3/3, that's what the table
gets reduced to. So you avoid writing 601 lines, instead add 23 lines to
the DT.

Sure, not all data. But if we have the relatively easy opportunity to
avoid further addition of data, we should do it, I believe.
This significantly reduces the amount of kernel code we need to add to
support new SoCs.

Andre.
