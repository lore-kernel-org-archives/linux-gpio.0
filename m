Sorry, I'm a newcomer in this area, so I was not aware of this.

Since this is a new binding consumer, is it something we can use
as role model to fix it?

If I understand correctly from reading up on the mailing list the root of the
problem is something like this:

"extcon" is a linuxism and ambiguous.

This driver should probe to "gpio-connector" or "gpio-switch" or something
like that if it should be generic. Or use very domain-specific compatible
strings (as you describe below), all supported maybe by the same driver
in the end.

The reason it is its own subsystem and not part of input (IIUC) is that
other drivers need to subscribe to events from these connectors,
they are not intended for userspace input such as keyboard or mice
or similar.

In the DTS file you will find stuff using extcons as resources with
 = <&extcon>; phandles so they can look them up and subscribe
to events.

Input has a whole slew of "events" that correspond to some of these
but a different usecase, but that usecase is just a linuxism in turn, there
is nothing saying another operating system could have a more versatile
defintion of "input".

Maybe from a hardware description PoV these should all move over
to devicetree/bindings/input - they all provice an input signal to the
system. The fact that Linux split a subset of these into "extcon"
is of no concern to the DT bindings.

Analogous with that some of the stuff in input/ should likely be
moved to a new output/ directory. Such as pwm-beeper,
pwm-vibrator etc. The fact that these are in the "input" subsystem
in Linux is just another linuxism.

> TL;DR: Anything extending the existing extcon binding will be NAKed.

That can be a reasonable stance.

I'm just trying to get this into a state where the code does not stand in
the way of kernel clean-up. (Especially I want to get rid of the call
to gpio_to_desc())

As stated in the cover letter the alternative will be to simply delete
the driver. But it's better if I can fix the situation, we can't have it
like this.

Yeah that is a problem with the whole subsystem I guess. Should
I add a paragraph describing the usecases?

The whole thing is a bit
of Androidism and is named like this because Android named it like
this in their kernel tree.

The idea is that this array corresponds to the extcon-connector-types
right below, I'll clarify that if you think the overall idea is OK.

So a GPIO connector is very versatile. It is "general purpose" by definition,
so it needs to be subclassed.

One possibility is to allow just one GPIO and have one comptible-string per
use case.
compatible = "gpio-usb-connector";
compatible = "gpio-charger-connector";
compatible = "gpio-headphone-connector";
etc etc

These bindings on the other hand, assume that the driver will be able
to handle an array of gpios with an associated array of connector types,
which reflects how many of the existing extcon-type driver hardware works:
a single PMIC providing some 5 misc extcons for example.

For this reason there is a generic compatible string and then the device
is subclassed per-gpio with the per-gpio connector type.

Someone else would have to answer, this is based on the current
connector types supported by the Linux kernel.

I guess they are not in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/extcon/*

Please point me in the right direction and I'll check it out.
