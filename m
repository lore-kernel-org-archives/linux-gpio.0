So what about the usecase for serial ports, where we use this
to make sure the console come out where we want it? Is that
also considered abuse or legitimate use? Note: I'm not trying to be
snarky, I'm trying to understand what is the right and wrong use
of alias. I'm confused about it right now :(

This is the big question, we all agree on that.

That is understandable. However as many people have pointed
out, if this is inherently broken since the introduction of
off-chip devices and even more by deferred probing. For some
odd silicon state making one GPIO's clock or something randomly
defer the probe, this would happen to become unpredictable
also on SoC-embedded GPIO chips. It's just that we don't see
it very much because it is deterministic in practice.

We need to face it: relying on fixed GPIO numbering is just a
big fragile mess that we're trying to duct-tape.

Yeah and the argument is that the numbering also of the chip
instance should be made more deterministic, so gpiochip0,
gpiochip1 ... gpiochipN are intuitive to a human user.

That is super-unintuitive for a human user, I agree 100%.

I agree, and I think that if aliases can alleviate the situation we sho=
uld
allow them and encourage them. They are the best duct-tape we can
find for the DT systems.

Unfortunately it is not my call, because DT bindings and alias use
is not under my jurisdiction.

I *THINK* the view of the device core maintainers is that udev
and sysfs hierarchies should be used to uniquely identify a certain
device, and that relying on device numbering is too fragile.

The network and disks people faced this problem before us, and
their solution was things like using sysfs/udev to make sure
the device get presented the right way to userspace and
handled the way it should.
