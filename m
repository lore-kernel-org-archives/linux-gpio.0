Just to be a little more precise,
     - 0: drive low
     - 1: drive high
     - 2: input with interrupt triggering
     - 3: LDO on
     - 4: LDO off
     - 5~7: floating (or ADC)

for AXP813, and
     - 0: drive low
     - 1: drive high
     - 2: input with interrupt triggering
     - 3: LDO on
     - 4: ADC
     - 5~7: floating

for AXP209.

So I think what you suggested Linus is not really relevant here as the
regulator framework will take care of disabling the regulator when
needed (for AXP813 via the ldo_off "muxing" selected by the regulator
framework).

However, there is no LDO off bit for AXP209 and the LDO can't be set to
0V in any other register. What's done now in the regulator driver for
AXP209 is to select the floating "muxing" for the pin when wanting to
disable the regulator. So I guess that's a way to handle it. Should we
do it another way?

Thanks for raising the issue, I frankly haven't thought about that at all.

I have to send a v4 to update the support for AXP813 (basically setting
ADC muxing to 0x5 instead of 0x4, for AXP813) as I misread the muxing
register description when adding support for it.

Thanks,
Quentin
