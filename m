The Arizona devices only maintain the state of output GPIOs whilst the
CODEC is active, this can cause issues if the CODEC suspends whilst
something is relying on the state of one of its GPIOs. However, in
many systems the CODEC GPIOs are used for audio related features
and thus the state of the GPIOs is unimportant whilst the CODEC is
suspended. Often keeping the CODEC resumed in such a system would
incur a power impact that is unacceptable.

Add a flag through the second cell of the GPIO specifier in device
tree, to allow the user to select whether a GPIO being configured as
an output should keep the CODEC resumed.
