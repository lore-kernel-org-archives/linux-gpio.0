Also include Heiko St=C3=BCbner and Doug Andersson who are also
interested in hierarchical pin controllers on subsequent postings.

I understand so far. Spell out what the acronym AON means. Does
it mean "always-on?"

I don't understand this at all.

What is "high level multiplex"?

Since you mention parents I suspect that what you are referring to is
that the pins are hierarchical, and that they are controlled by two
levels of pin controllers, such that a physical pin is connected to pin
controller A which can multiplex pins to N functions, and then the line
from A is connected to another pin controller B that can again multiplex
to M other functions?

Please describe this hardware set-up with *lots* of detail so we have
a chance of understanding it fully. All necessary information shall go
into this DT binding document so we know where to look it up.

I don't understand this. I suspect the English language may be a
problem here, I think "as much as" should be "as many as", also
subject and object is very hard to understand when the pin controller
is referred to as "itself". It's just very hard to parse, sorry. Please
elaborate and I will try to understand and help as much as I can.

Again hard to understand, but why do you need two nodes
and not just two register areas regs =3D <a b>, <c d>;?

I guess because one pin controller is using another one but
I'm not sure.

The problem with this devicetree is that it does not express the hierarchic=
al
nature that you describe above. And I have no idea how the driver
handles that relation. These look like two independent pin controller
but AFAICT they are not.

These are arrangements that make more sense:

pinctrla {
    compatible =3D "parent-device-compat";
    (...)
    pinctrlb {
        compatible =3D "child-device-compat";
        (...)
    };
};

This makes the child pin controller a proper child of the parent and
make the child probe instantiate from the parent (in
Linux of_platform_default_populate() inside the parent driver)
and thus it knows the parent is always available before the child.

Another arrangement is:

pa: pinctrla {
    compatible =3D "parent-device-compat";
    (...)
};

pb: pinctrlb {
    compatible =3D "child-device-compat";
    pinctrl-parent =3D &pinctrla;
    (...)
};

This is in case we need to have hierarchies defined this way.

I don't know the best way to define hierarchical pin controllers yet
so we definately need some discussion about it.
