This is something where it seems like it would be very easy for people
to end up relying on current OS behaviour even if that only happened
through accident rather than design.  You might assume that such
behaviour is a bug but that may not be obvious to the firmware author if
the OS behaviour makes sense to them.

There may also be some expectation on the part of firmware that the OS
will do some management of the pins even for devices that it's not
actively working with (put them in an idle mode for example).

The other issue here is that if (as Octavian mentioned) there are
ongoing discussions within ASWG on producing an actual spec for this it
doesn't seem great that we'd just go and do something completely
different rather than trying to make sure that the spec works well.  Or
if there isn't any spec work then writing one there for other OSs to
pick up if they like.  This seems like it'd make us much better
community players.
