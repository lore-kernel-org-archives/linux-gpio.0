Thanks!

So this leaves only:

  [PATCH v3 11/20] devicetree: bindings: add Device Tree bindings for Armada 39x pin-muxing controller
  [PATCH v3 15/20] pinctrl: mvebu: add pinctrl driver for Marvell Armada 39x

to be applied, right? Patch 15/20 has been applied by Linus Walleij
already, but from the v1 of the series. I also asked him to merge PATCH
v3 11/20.

With this done, and PATCH v2 20/20 merged by the arm-soc maintainers, I
guess we should be all set with this patch series.

Thanks again!

Best regards,

Thomas
