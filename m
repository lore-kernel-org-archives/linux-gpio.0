got your concern, will send an update.

My tested compilers do the work right, but I can not be sure about the
whole variety of compilers, well, probably I should just follow the
standard, which in turn is expected to be quite volatile in future
revisions regarding usage of "_Bool" or future "bool" type.

If we assume the preferred Linux kernel style to use true/false
constants for boolean variables only (see the reference to
bool{init,return}.cocci), then even if bitwise and arithmetic operations
on bool type are understandable to a compiler, but probably "false <<
true" (or whatever is hidden under a variable name) is not quite
aesthetic for a human eye. This is not a technical argument though, and
I'm not sure if any clear code style policy related to the case is agreed.
