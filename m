Just so that I understand, this means that you asked within Intel for an
ACPI ID, but couldn't get one allocated?

This sounds like a workaround for an internal process issue.

Surely there are other ACPI folk within Intel you can poke to move that
along?

This paragraph is not relevant to the description of the device, nor is
any of this relvevant to DT, given (AFAICT), this is only intended to be
used with ACPI.

This only has a compatible string?

As I've mentioned in the past, I'm not a fan of the whole PRP0001
approach, especially given that little care seems to be taken to
actually comply with DT standards.

Thanks,
Mark.
