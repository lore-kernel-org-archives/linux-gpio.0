Not sure if it's -EINVAL, but some error for sure, yes.

It's not known to the driver. On an i.MX28 based machine a certain pin
of the SoC might be NC and so should be set as output-low. That's
specific to that machine while the i.MX28 (and so the driver) could well
operate that pin as input. It might also make sense to limit a line to
input only if it is connected to another device that drives the line.

So this is entirely independent of the driver in question.

I guess you disagree to the 2nd sentence only because the first is
obviously true.

gpio-hogs are a special case of my suggestion. So even if the binding
looks different in the end, it doesn't make sense to have two
implementations for the same thing.

This is my favourite binding among the stuff discussed given you don't
want to "reuse" gpio-hog, but I'm open for better ones :-)

The following looks nice:

	io12 {
		gpio;
		gpio = <4 0>;
		init-output-low;
		fixed-direction;
		fixed-value;
	};

but won't work because there is "gpio" twice.

If you ask me, having

	io12 {
		gpio-init;
		gpio = <4 0>;
		output-low;
		fixed-direction;
		fixed-value;
	};

somehow makes it superfluous to be able to say

	io12 {
		gpio-hog;
		gpio = <4 0>;
		output-low;
	};

as the only difference would be that with the former the gpio could be
requested while this isn't possible with the latter. (Which is also a
difference that shouldn't be there in a hardware description.)

Rob: IMHO it makes sense to describe limitations like "This pin should
not be driven (as there is another driver)" or "This is an output pin
with the safe initial level being low" (for a line that drives the reset
pin of a device) or maybe even "This pin might be used as input or
output, the safe value is input" (for a pin that is available on a
pinheader with a pullup, so the usage is unknown) in the device tree. I
don't really care about how they should be specified, so if you have a
different idea, I'm all ears.

Best regards
Uwe
