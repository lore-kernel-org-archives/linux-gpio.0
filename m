This is going to be a problem for Pin 36:

PINGROUP(36, rmii0, *led2*, *led0*, NA, ...)

I checked the other pins too, but this seems to be the only time two 
LED-lines share the same pin. What's the recommended/prefered option
in this case? Something like led_alt, or should I keep the led0-led11?

There are a few more collisions with other functions as well:
smartX, i2s_*, wifi1_uart*:

PINGROUP(58, qpic, led2, blsp_i2c0, *smart3*, *smart1*,
         i2s_rx_mclk, NA, wcss0_dbg, tm4, wifi0, wifi1, NA, NA, NA),

PINGROUP(60, qpic, blsp_uart0, smart1, smart3, led0,
         *i2s_tx_bclk*, *i2s_rx_bclk*, atest_char, NA, wcss0_dbg,
         qdss_traceclk_a, NA, tm6, NA),

PINGROUP(61, qpic, blsp_uart0, *smart1*, *smart3*, led1, *i2s_tx_fsync*,
         *i2s_rx_fsync*, NA, NA, wcss0_dbg, qdss_cti_trig_out_a0,
         NA, tm7, NA),

PINGROUP(63, qpic, wifi0_uart1, *wifi1_uart1*, *wifi1_uart*, *i2s_td1*,
         *i2s_rxd*, *i2s_spdif_out*, *i2s_spdif_in*, NA, wcss0_dbg,
         wcss1_dbg, NA, tm, NA),

Thanks for the answer, I'll go with "qpic" then.
I'll also combine the various sdio_* to sdio and look at the other candidates
(rgmii*, rmii0/1*, pmuX, pcie_clk*, jtag*, tmX, audio_pwmX). Unless someone
comes up with a good reason not to.

Christian
