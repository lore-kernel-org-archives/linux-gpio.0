Yep. At first glance, everything seemed more simple.

Honestly, I think, It is better to keep Keystone 2 functionality in 
standalone file [1], as it allows to simply manage this code using
build system, avoid ugly #ifdefs in code (as you note on patch 3)
and keep commits history more clear and HW specific (very helpful in 
case of any issues). 

But, as you agree now to take this syscon-based patches, I'll update & re-send them,
applying comments from Alexander to the patch 1 and your comments to the patch 3 :)

Thanks for your comments.
