Three reasons I can think of:

1) The GPIO binding already provides for passing extra information
through the binding ("Exact meaning of each specifier cell is controller
specific" as it says in the main gpio binding doc) so why add yet
another custom property to do it?

2) Doing it through the gpio means that if ultimately the child DT node
that is using it gets disabled (status="disabled") or that driver isn't
in use the codec will be able to go to sleep. That won't happen with a
brute-force "big lock".

3) The codec only has to be kept awake while any such GPIO is actually
in use. See (2)
