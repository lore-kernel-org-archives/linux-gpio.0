I guess s/Linux/Linus Walleij/?

Just to be on the same term, we are talking about these two variants:

--------------------------------------------
gpio: host-gpio {
    random-properties;
}

inv: line-inverter {
    /*
     * configure the gpio controller input to be active low
     * and the inverter interrupt output to be active low
     */
    interrupts =3D <&gpio ACTIVE_LOW>;
};

mcp23xxx {
    random-properties;

    /*
     * configure the chip interrupt output to be active high=20
     * and the inverter interrupt input to be active high
     */
    interrupts =3D <&inv ACTIVE_HIGH>;
}
--------------------------------------------

versus

--------------------------------------------
gpio: host-gpio {
    random-properties;
}

mcp23xxx {
    random-properties;

    /* configure host interrupt input pin to be active low */
    interrupts =3D <&gpio ACTIVE_LOW>;

    /* configure chip interrupt output pin to be active high */
    microchip,irq-active-high;
}
--------------------------------------------

I think this is something, that Rob should comment on. Obviously at
least in the mainline kernel nobody implemented the first solution
(since there is no fitting interrupt-invert driver), but there are
a few instances of the second variant. On the other hand the first
solution describes the hardware more detailed.

IMHO the explicit line-inverter is a bit over-engineered and
implicit line-inverter is enough, but I'm fine with both solutions.
I think the DT binding maintainers should comment on this though,
since it's pretty much a core decision about interrupt specifiers.
