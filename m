We are using the gpio driver with gpio_key for power button. The gpio
status can only be retrieved from the GIC register when the gpio is
acting as a interrupt. Marc had provided a patch which allow the
getting of the irq status
using the PENDING_SET register, however it seems it is not reliable.
Another register in the GIC call the SPISR always give the correct
status but it is only available in the GIC-400 and hence not likely to
be incorporated into the general GIC code. We would like to go back
the version 1 of the patch and ioremap the region in the gpio driver
and access the status that way. Please let us know what you think.
