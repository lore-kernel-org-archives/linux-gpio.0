Linus,

This above if statement does not make sense. Sure empty strings are okay but it
seems that an error would be printed even when the name is set above when ret
is 0.

Using else if perhaps would make more sense.

Looking at the above of_gpiochip_set_names function it always returns 0. Not
sure if that was the intention but it renders this if statement below
useless.
