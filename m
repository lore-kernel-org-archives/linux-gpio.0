Number of double-inverters I guess, just as it says.

skew-delay = <1>; // number of inverter pairs

Like with other bindings of this type they are custom.

The Gemini datasheet says "every unit represents about 0.2 ns".

So if you set it to 1, that means (as far as I can guess) this
is shunted in:

   |\    |\
--+ >o--+ >o---
   |/    |/

The signal will take ~0.2 ns to propagate through this.
For 2, there will be four inverters etc.

It is dependent of production technology, and I do not know
if everyone is using something like double-inverters.

We could try to define a value in picoseconds instead so I
would need to set this to 200 in that case if you think that is better:

skew-delay = <200>; // picoseconds

I think it would be kludgy since with increasing clock speeds
maybe picoseconds would be too big even. Nanoseconds is
apparently already a to coarse unit.
