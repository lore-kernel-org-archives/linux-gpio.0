This doesn't seem good. You are starting to duplicate stuff
that is already available inside the gpio-generic.c driver.

Why can't this driver just select GPIO_GENERIC in
Kconfig and use the common code for handling
the endianness accessors?

bgpio_init() takes a flag
BGPIOF_BIG_ENDIAN_BYTE_ORDER
to make all accesses big endian, so using the
generic GPIO library would save you a lot of code.

Just look at other drivers for those selecting GPIO_GENERIC,
including <linux/basic_mmio_gpio.h> and calling bgpio_init().
You might want to keep some local custom BE code around
the IRQ parts.

But I would do two patches:
- One that switches MPC8xxx to using GENERIC_GPIO
- One that adds BE support using that infrastructure

It will result in a lot less code. I think.
