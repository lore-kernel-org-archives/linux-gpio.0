K, will deliver. I noticed that you sent a mail in which you stated
that you applied the dt binding already. Can you update your devel
branch on git.kernel.org's linux-gpio? Then, I'll simply rebase my
series and sent the remaining two patches.
(unless you tell me otherwise).

Yeah, I had to remove all non wd related bits. But since this=20
series was posted (over and over :D) on a public mailing-list
the original  "generic" linux-mmio binding is available for
everybody to perusal[0] and study. I think what we can make
would be something like a devicetree template out of it. This
way people can remove unused flags and regnames for their
compatible device tree binding. (But first: need to finish
that ppc-gpio.txt).

Ah, I was thinking about Documentation/gpio... Since there's no
way it would go in the devicetree/bindings without having a compatible?
(And there's technically none). As far as I know the problem here is no=
t
that it would be impossible to do that (updating a .dts file is "easy".=
=2E.),
but updating .dtb to a tiny flash-rom on the device might not be. So we
have to make every effort to preserve compatibility for those devices
(and old/incomplete/broken dtbs) as long as the device is supported.

About adding new device:
This will work in the following way:=20
 1. new drives will need to supply their hardware-specific devicetree
    binding file to the dt maintainers (This "vendor,device.txt" file
    will be like the wd,mbl-gpio.txt - but modified for the hardware
    (this is where the template would be handy)

 2. Make a one-liner patch which adds a compatible string to
    gpio-mmio.c's bgpio_of_match table:

+	{ .compatible =3D "vendor,device", .data =3D bgpio_basic_mmio_parse_d=
t },

(Of course, not having parses for the "ngpio" property and the flags li=
ke
big-endian, reg-output-reg,set, unreadable-reg-dir, ... properties from
the get-go is sad, these can add back once a driver/binding needs it).

I think brcm63xx will be following shortly. So we can test the
procedure.

Well, to do that, I think we need to collect enough devices to
make it a real "class" of devices first.
