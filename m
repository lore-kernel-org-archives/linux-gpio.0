Hi Alexandre,

I tried to stay away while things are being fleshed out but=E2=80=A6

Do not count on the bootloader setting up anything. The trend is
for the bootloader to setup the minimal environment to load your kernel
and jump to it.

That=E2=80=99s why I was advocating a simple probing driver for all thi=
s.
=46igure out a way for this driver to be probed first would be an easie=
r
solution that what=E2=80=99s going on here.
