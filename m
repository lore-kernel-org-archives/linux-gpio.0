please give it a test run (with and without DTS gpio-ranges changes,
or just 2/3 from the series), I've tested on iMX6Q SabreLite, SabreAuto,
SabreSD and I don't see any regressions or noticeable increase of
-EPROBE_DEFER hits due to not ready GPIOs.

IMHO that will be the case, if the change 2/3 from the series is applied.

Statisticaly most of GPIO consumers should settle on device_initcall or
module_init level, the latter one is translated to device_initcall if
a driver is built-in, so the proposed downgrading of GPIO controller
driver init call level looks to be appropriate.

However pinctrl/pinmux driver should definitely have higher init level
priority in comparison to GPIO controller driver, every GPIO consumer
is a pinctrl/pinmux consumer as well, most of iMX pinctrl/pinmux drivers
are initialized at arch_initcall level, so there is a plenty of options
to satisfy (GPIO driver initcall) < (pinmux/pinctrl driver initcall)
equation:
* change pinmux/pinctrl driver initcall level to postcore_initcall
   and GPIO driver initcall level to arch_initcall or lower one,
* keep pinmux/pinctrl driver at arch_initcall level, set GPIO driver
   initcall level to any lower than arch_initcall (e.g. device_initcall)
* keep everything as is, drop 2/3 and rely on -EPROBE_DEFER from
   GPIO driver probe due to not yet initialized pinctrl driver.

 From what I see it is the case for the most critical drivers, for the
rest I believe it is a bug, which can be revealed by shifting GPIO
driver initcall level and fixed, see also
