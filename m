I would normally advice to use the right modeling from the start, create
the MFD driver and spawn the devices from there. It is confusing
if the layout of the driver(s) doesn't really match the layout of the
hardware.

I understand that it is a pain to write new MFD drivers to get your
things going and it would be "nice to get this working really quick
now" but in my experience it is better to do it right from the start.
