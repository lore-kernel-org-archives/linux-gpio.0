It is the pinctrl provider indeed.

Correct.

I actually meant that a consumer driver could aalso call
pinctrl_select_state() in one of its resume callback for instance, but
if the pinctrl provider driver does nothing (or rather the core, on
behalf of the provider), this would be an issue. This was not super
clear, so I will stop using that example from now on :)
