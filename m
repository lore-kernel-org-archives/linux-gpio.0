I'm still fine if we want to confine this "gpio forwarding" to acpi
if you guys want it, but I was looking at the Sound SoC drivers and I
realised that we do have places which pass gpio descriptors to other
devices in platform data. And these of course aren't always used on
acpi platforms. By greping gpio_desc I saw at least these files are
passing it in platform data structures:

include/sound/soc.h
include/linux/leds.h
include/linux/usb/usb_phy_generic.h

There are probable others but I checked those. And of course now there
is nothing preventing people from adding more of them.

So we could use my original idea with them. I think most of the
drivers using those are tied to separate handling for dt and pdata
only because of the way the gpio descriptor is delivered to them.

What do you guys think?
