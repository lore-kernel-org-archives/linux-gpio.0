It's not about the hardware haven an input-only GPIO, but on the board
it might be bad to drive the GPIO because another device already drives
it.

What I want is that it is possible to restrict the usage of a GPIO more
fine-grained. For example only fix the direction to input but allow a
driver to still read out it's value. Or fix the direction to output but
allow changing the level. So the semantic of a hogged gpio as
implemented today is a special case of my new use cases. So it seems
naturally to extend the already existing concept.

And concerning the meaning of hogging: It still takes some freedom from
others, just not everything because you can still request the line. So
not being a native English speaker the word still fits for me.

And technically it is sensible to implement the new use cases and
today's hogging together and so it is also sensible IMHO to use the same
mechanism in the device tree.

So to stick to your suggestion I would have in the end for two lines
io12 that must be 0 for ESD reasons and io13 that drives the RST-line of
a companion DSP that should be kept low until userspace is ready and
then allow being driven high via gpioctl:

	io12 {
		gpio-hog;
		gpio =3D <4 0>;
		output-low;
	};

	io13 {
		gpio-init;
		gpio =3D <5 0>;
		output-low;
		fixed-direction;
	};

For me it looks artificial to not use "gpio-hog" for the 2nd
specification but if that is the compromise that we can agree on, that's
ok for me.

Orthogonal to gpio-hog being used for this or not, I like

	output-low;
	fixed-direction;

better than

	output-low-init;

as the former is more intuitive.

Uwe
