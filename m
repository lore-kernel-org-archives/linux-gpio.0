I think I remember that -gpio is considered obsolete and its use
should thus not be encouraged, which is the reason why the
documentation does not mention it. We could mention it and add a note
saying that it should not be used for new bindings, but all in all
isn't it better to keep the documentation clear of such use cases that
will not be accepted for new patches anyway?
