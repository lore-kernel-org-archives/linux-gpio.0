Of course, my git-fu let me down.

There's a wide range of systems implementing this, but I think it's all
software. The definition of the individual bits used to be defined by
one large enum, but it looks like Qualcomm ran out of bits and started
to re-use them.

But the functions are always well defined for a given platform.

Looking forward to hearing his comments :)

I have not been able to find any other suitable framework to expose this
functionality with and I am hoping to not be forced to create a new one
as this one fits the purpose well.

There are basically 2 versions; the original version comprised the
application cpu and the modem cpu, sometime around 2008-2009 this was
replaced with something called "N-way SMSM" - i.e. this implementation.
The only change since then is in the number of entries and number of
hosts - which we can determine in runtime if it's not compatible with
the original sizes.


So I have not been able to find any reasons to be more specific.


Thanks for taking a look.
