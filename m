Internally there are three banks. Due to the fact the address space is
meshed, It was agreed that we turn this into one simple node.

I will update documentation to indicate second cell is used for active low and
active high setting since that is the behavior of the default of_xlate
function. All it is
seems to be doing is flipping the value of the gpio. I initially did
this because I
did not want to use additional attributes and followed the example
documentation of
number of other gpio driver.

Yes, no interrupts in this block.
