To be honest, I'm not sure. From a quick grep, most of_parse_phandle()
instances are only grabbing element 0, and without digging I can only
see a couple that do more than that. There's probably not that big a hit
in those cases.

I'm happy either way, so feel free to stick my ack on with or without:
