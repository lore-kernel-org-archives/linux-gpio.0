What I meant was convert the drivers, not the dts files to a generic
driver. There is no benefit here from a dts perspective. It is driver
consolidation that would make all this worthwhile.

This is not a compatible change. You can't remove the old drivers as
they are needed to work with old dtbs, so there is no gain.

You would need to match on existing compatibles such as
moxa,moxart-gpio and provide a match data struct that has all the info
you are adding here (e.g. data register offset). Then additionally you
could add "basic-mmio-gpio" (I would drop "basic" part) and the
additional data associated with it. But it has to be new properties,
not changing properties. Changing the reg values doesn't work.

Those are a good start. My other worry about this is next someone will
want to add interrupt registers which is probably a majority of GPIO
controllers.

Of course, I'm sure Linus has an opinion on all of this.
