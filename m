I'm not Linus, but after a quick look at the drivers mentioned by
Christian I see little room for improvement (but still some - see
below). Like Rob mentioned we want the DT's compatible property to
describe the hardware as precisely as possible. "basic-mmio-gpio" is
not precise and not backward-compatible. The examples listed by
Christian are already all using the generic MMIO driver and are thus
already quite short.

However, they all repeat the same basic sequence to initialize the
generic IOMMU driver, and maybe this could be consolidated in a single
file, with each matching chip having the arguments passed to
bgpio_init() encoded as data (a bit like the simple-panel driver does
- see the platform_of_match member of
drivers/gpu/drm/panel/panel-simple.c)

This would reduce the amount of code that basically does the same
thing, and remove a few files from drivers/gpio. Even there I see that
gpio-clps711x.c has some specifics compared to the other drivers, but
maybe Christian can iron them out.

So without touching the DT I think consolidating the bgpio users in a
fashion similar to what simple-panel does would be worthwhile.
