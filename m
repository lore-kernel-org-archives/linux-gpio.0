This patchset adds gpio support for Actions Semi S900 SoC by extending
the pinctrl driver. There were previous patches submitted for adding a
standalone gpio driver based on gpiolib. But later on it has been realised
that the gpio functionality is closely tied with pinctrl subsystem for this
OWL family processors. So, having a separate gpio driver will make it hard
to add further functionalities in future. Hence, we decided to drop the
previous patches below adding a standalone gpio support:

dt-bindings: gpio: Add gpio nodes for Actions S900 SoC
arm64: dts: actions: Add S900 gpio nodes
arm64: dts: actions: Add gpio line names to Bubblegum-96 board
gpio: Add gpio driver for Actions OWL S900 SoC
MAINTAINERS: Add Actions Semi S900 pinctrl and gpio entries

This patchset consits of incremental patches which will apply with the
previous pinctrl series: Add Actions Semi S900 pinctrl and gpio support,
excluding the dropped patches mentioned above.

Thanks,
Mani
