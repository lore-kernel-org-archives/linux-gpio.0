Good point. It might also be that older SoCs have MSTP bits for the GPIO cores 
but don't document them. Anyway, we have no information, so we can't specify a 
clock.

I'm fine with keeping in under "Optional Properties". I would phrase it as 
"Must contain a reference to the functional clock. The property is mandatory 
if the hardware implements a controllable functional clock for the GPIO 
instance." (or something similar).
