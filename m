I forgot one most important reason why we can not use the "sleep" state. As I explained
above, the sleep related configuration will bind with the pin's sleep mode. If we set the
pin's sleep mode as AP_SLEEP, then we can select "sleep" state when AP system goes into
deep sleep mode by issuing "pinctrl_force_sleep()" in pinctrl suspend function.

But if we set the pin's sleep mode as PUBCP_SLEEP and pubcp system doesn't run linux kernel
(it run another thread OS), then we can not select "sleep" state since the AP system does
not go into deep sleep mode (AP system run linux kernel OS).
