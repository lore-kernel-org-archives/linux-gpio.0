We have two type of IPs, GPIO mode is configured in the register which 
is part of GPIO controller and in other IP, it is configured in register 
which is in pincontroller registers.

Your suggested API pinctrl_is_gpio() will definitely help on second case 
and I will work on this once we will have the new IP driver in mainline. 
This will be in coming T186 patches.


For T210 SoC, the configuration is done in gpio controller and we need 
to have debug utility outside of driver and hence the requirements was.
