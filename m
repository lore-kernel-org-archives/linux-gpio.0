In general, I'd like to keep drivers in control over how and when the
reset is asserted; mainly because there are variations of reset,
powerdown/enable, and bootstrap pins that have to be taken into account.

On some devices the powerdown needs to be deasserted before the reset
can work, on some devices it might be the other way around, or the
powerdown pin may cause a reset itself, or there are bootstrap pins that
need to be configured a certain way while the reset is issued (but are
used for something else while the device is active). Others occasionally
need to reset the chip while in operation.

If you expect none of those issues for GPIO chips, I don't argue against
doing this for the drivers in gpiochip_add, if it is documented that
this function might reset the chip.
This would work with a separate gpio reset provider driver by just
calling device_reset(chip->dev) at the end of gpiochip_add.
With my previous suggestion, as Maxime points out, I'd still need to
find a way to provide the duration of the reset pulse.

Ideally it should be the same as all other devices with an external
reset pin.

Yes, it does what you want. But its purpose is different, it's a bit
indirect for the use case at hand, and we'll still find cases where this
won't work (interaction with other pins). As to whether the sub-node
might conflict with existing bindings, I don't know. This is something
that should be taken to devicetree discussion list.
