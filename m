Will do.

Yes, I suppose I should have said "a reversion to your earlier
implementation" above :).  I'd be happy to to add your Signed-of-by if
you would like, but you'll have to let me know which email address to
use (the one in the original downstream submission or this one).

I could do that, but I was just using the existing argument so now you
are editing yourself ;).  I'll think about it.

Sounds better.  I'll consider that too.

That is more or less where I started, but the "ugliness" began creeping
in with the need to wrap that last line at 80 characters. It seemed
silly to declare two separate ints for transitory purposes just to make
the naming clearer, but I'll revisit it too.

Thanks for taking the time and the thoughtful feedback,
