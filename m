Well, textually you may be making the minimal changes (though the error
handling adds some "boilerplate" kfree()s etc.), but semantically adding
two kmallocs in a loop could be a big deal. Dunno, maybe in practice all
the gpios (almost always) belong to the same chip, so there's only one
iteration through the loop anyway.

No idea, it was just a drive-by comment, so also...

... I don't "want" anything, that'll be for the gpio maintainers to decide.
