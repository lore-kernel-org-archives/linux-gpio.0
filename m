Is there anything I can do to help this along? This series
and the tps65086 series have been blocked for months on
trivial issues. (Not sure why the tps65086 hasn't been taken,
it doesn't have this problem, I'd be OK with this getting
stalled for a bit longer if someone could look at the other
one)
