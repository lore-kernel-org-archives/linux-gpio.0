Hi Linus,

Thanks for your review on the whole series.

ST MFX is based on a STM32L152 with a firmware offering features similar 
to the STMPE (GPIO and TS controller) but also IDD measurement to 
measure the power consumption of the MCU to which MFX is connected to.

ST MFX is different from STMPE as far as the HW is completely different.
IDD is a new feature.
TS management is completely different.
GPIO management looks like but is also rather different.
ST MFX counts a first level of 8 interrupts (acked by writing in the ACK 
register), then a second level of 24 interrupts for GPIOs. GPIO IRQ can 
be triggered on low level, falling edge, high level, rising edge. GPIO 
IRQ have to be acked by writing in the GPI_ACK register, GPIO can be 
output open-drain with/without internal pull-up, output push-pull, input 
with pull-up/down, input floating or analog.

Sure, but if it was a new STMPE variant, it would be called STMPE24xx or 
something like that (24 GPIOs maximum, 20 if IDD or TS is enabled, 16 if 
IDD and TS are enabled).
