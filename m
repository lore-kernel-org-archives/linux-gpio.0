That DSP is to just give different name since there
is another GPIO IP on keystone. We can get rid of that
DSP name but I think thats not your concern.

Am sorry to say but real, unreal is very debatable.
A SOC can have more than one IP instance for different
purposes.

Using GPIO as an interrupt line is a legitimate
usecase already supported GPIO lib.

Not at all. The usecase is different. remoteproc's are more
for firmware download, powerup, powerdown, boot an external
co-processor.

I respect your view but in this particular case, I just
thought we are denying a legitimate plumbing. Because if
it doesn't fit here, fitting it in other subsystems will
be shoehorning in my view.

I just think you are too much reading into that DSP name
which was just there to differentiate it from the other
GPIO IP.
