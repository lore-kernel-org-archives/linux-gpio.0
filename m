Do you mean splitting the GFX IP and enable register into two nodes?

We can't. Pinmux needs to check bit 6 and 7 in GFX064, which is in the
middle the IP block:

GFX060: CRT Control Register I
GFX064: CRT Control Register II
GFX068: CRT Status Register
GFX06C: CRT Misc Setting Register

We want the regmap to be present whenever the GFX driver or pinmux is
loaded. If we register it in pinmux but chose to not build in that
driver, we lack the regmap. Same for the case where a user builds in
the GFX driver and not pinmux. I think this means we want the syscon
compatible string, unless my understanding is wrong?

Cheers,

Joel
