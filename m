This patchset adds support for armada370-based NAS by DLINK.

DNS-327L is a 2-bay NAS with the following specs:     
     - 512MiB RAM
     - 128MiB NAND Flash
     - 1 GbE interface (Marvell PHY)
     - 1 rear USB 3.0 port (via PCIe USB 3.0 controller)
     - 2 internal SATA ports handled by the Armada 370: 
       	 uses 2 gpios for power control
     - two front 2-color leds (amber + white) for both discs, 
        controlled by the SoC
     - One white LED handled by SoC (USB)
     - 3 buttons. Power handled by weltrend, USB and 
       RESET (on the bottom) are wired via GPIOs 
     - Unidentified i2c device at address 0x13 (via i2cdetect)
     - UART0 providing serial console
     - Weltrend MCU serving for RTC, temperature, fan control, 
       and power button handling interfaced via UART1 (dns320l-daemon)
     
Hardware notes follow: 
Everything's supported, save for mysterious i2c device at 
address 0x13 that I couldn't even find on the PCB.

Stock firmware performs some messing with PHY registers (that 
have no public documentation) using a userspace script. With 
upstream kernel it is possible to match the stock behavior using 
the following in u-boot prompt:

mw.l 0xd00184e0 0xa8a; 
phyWrite 0 16 2; 
phyWrite 0 19 77; 
phyWrite 0 18 5747; 

When power button is pressed to turn the NAS off, weltrend signals 
the SoC by driving mpp63 line low. Apparently right now pinctrl assumes
that this line can only work as 'gpo' that screws up gpio-buttons driver.
Since without gpio-buttons, mpp63 works as input properly via sysfs 
interface, I've added a patch for pinctrl-armada-370.c that fixes the 
issue.

The only remaining issue are hard-freezes every 4-16 hours when
CONFIG_ARM_MVEBU_V7_CPUIDLE=y
As of 3.18 this issue was still present, I'm testing if things changed 
in 4.0-rc7 right now (Still live for 3 hours at the time of writing)
