Sounds better than the current situation.

This is a bad idea.

irq_data->parent_data corresponds to irq_domain->parent.
We should not lose consistency/symmetry.

irq_domain->parent originates in the "parent" argument
passed to irq_domain_create_hierarchy().
If we change this, it will introduce horrible confusion.

As the document says, when we talk about the hierarchy,
"the irq_domain near to the device is
child and the irq_domain near to CPU is parent"
This is the original concept, and should not be changed.


We can excuse that all the variables in these two helpers
were named from the point of linked-list view,
not talking about the hierarchy.


However, what I thought more confusing was the comment block.

/**
 * irq_domain_push_irq() - Push a domain in to the top of a hierarchy.


This comment is talking about the "hierarchy" at first glance.
So, what is my mind is the picture in Documentation/IRQ-domain.txt

But, from the term "top", this is talking about the linked list here too.
The linked list is just implementation detail...
