To avoid the static analysis complaints about the "if (slowpath)
kfree(slowpath)" pattern, I'd suggest getting rid of the slowpath
variable and simply assign the kcalloc directly to mask. Then the
condition becomes "if (mask != fastpath) kfree(mask)". A comment won't
silence subsequenct coccicheck runs, and unfortunately probably won't
prevent certain individuals from sending auto-generated patches.

Maybe also pull out the "bits = mask + BITS_TO_LONGS(chip->ngpio)" to
the common path.

Another thing: Maybe a pr_warn or at least a pr_info would be in order
when a gpio chip with > FASTPATH_NGPIO lines is registered? And if that
triggers for a lot of different SoCs, one could consider changing it to
a CONFIG_ thing, or just bumping it to 512 if that would seem to cover
all the reports.
