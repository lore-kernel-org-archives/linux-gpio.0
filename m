Yes, I am in this mail-list too, but I also had a issue on this, I
think you are still in my submitted for this.
Currently, irq_get|set_irqchip_state(..) supports access to
GIC_DIST_ENABLE_SET, GIC_DIST_ACTIVE_SET, GIC_DIST_PENDING_SET. But
our hw only has the valid value at SPISR register ("[PATCH v4 2/3]
irqchip: GIC: Add support for irq_{get,set}_irqchip_state"), so I
still can not use it.

Let me think how.

In irq mode, if I reconfigured that gpio pin to gpio mode, then
reading -> the value is valid.
Could I do that way badly ? It means switch to gpio mode to read
value, then switch back to  irq mode.
