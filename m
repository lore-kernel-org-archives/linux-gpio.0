Thanks for clarifying.  This would be great information to include in
the commit message.

Considering this is heavily based on my initial implementation (several
functions are exactly the same), it'd be nice to have some small
attribution in the commit message. :-)

OK, that sounds like a worse alternative.  And since these are all
actually using the same parent IRQ, it does make sense to keep them all
in the same IRQ domain.

Consider renaming "offset" to "hwirq".

Consider renaming "gc_offset" to "offset" and "offset" to "hwirq" to
keep things consistent.

I'm not a fan of the change to use "irq" to mean several different
things in this function.  How about this instead?

static void brcmstb_gpio_irq_bank_handler(struct brcmstb_gpio_bank *bank)
{
	struct brcmstb_gpio_priv *priv = bank->parent_priv;
	struct irq_domain *domain = priv->irq_domain;
	int hwbase = bank->gc.base - priv->gpio_base;
	unsigned long status;

	while ((status = brcmstb_gpio_get_active_irqs(bank))) {
		int offset;

		for_each_set_bit(offset, &status, 32) {
			if (offset >= bank->width)
 				dev_warn(&priv->pdev->dev,
 					 "IRQ for invalid GPIO (bank=%d, offset=%d)\n",
					 bank->id, offset);
			generic_handle_irq(irq_linear_revmap(domain, offset + hwbase));

The rest looks good.

Thanks,
