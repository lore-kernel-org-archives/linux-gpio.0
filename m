No, I'm just saying I don't see how calling the mux positions "IN1AL"
is any clearer than calling them "A" and "B". The "IN1AL" names of the
DAPM widgets is purely an internal detail that you wouldn't see through
the ALSA interface anyway so they don't relate any more closely to what
Joe user is seeing in the control list. The IN1L mux is for IN1L
so including that information in the mux position is redundant. For me
the real benefit of the "A"/"B" naming is that if you're reading through
a configuration script and saw something like

    'IN1L Mux' = 'B'
    'IN1R Mux' = 'B'

It's much more readably obvious that both channels are set the same
rather than

    'IN1L Mux' = 'IN1BL'
    'IN1R Mux' = 'IN1BR'

The second version doesn't tell you any more information than the first
but makes it harder to scan so you have to read more carefully to check
the settings

They only need to be set the same if the "A" input is set to digital mic
mode because that uses pins from both the left and right channel to
run the single digital interface. If the A input is analogue the two
channels are independant so the left/right muxes can be set to A or B
inputs independantly.
