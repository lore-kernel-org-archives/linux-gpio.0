There are a number of other boards that need such fixing too. And the
commit in question does not do a good job of explaining why it was
needed in the first place. The description  just repeats what can be
inferred by reading the patch.


    gpio: davinci: Do not assume continuous IRQ numbering

    Currently the driver assumes that the interrupts are continuous
    and does platform_get_irq only once and assumes the rest are continuous,
    instead call platform_get_irq for all the interrupts and store them
    in an array for later use.

Can we revert the offending commit instead?

Thanks,
