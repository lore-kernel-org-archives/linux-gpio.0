Make it possible to name the producer side of a GPIO line using
a "gpio-names" property array, modeled on the "clock-names"
property from the clock bindings.

This naming is especially useful for:

- Debugging: lines are named after function, not just opaque
  offset numbers.

- Exploration: systems where some or all GPIO lines are available
  to end users, such as prototyping, one-off's "makerspace usecases"
  users are helped by the names of the GPIO lines when tinkering.
  This usecase has been surfacing recently.

The gpio-names attribute is completely optional.

This has been discussed at some length now.

Why we are not using hogs: these are consumer side, not producer
side. The gpio-controller in DT (gpio_chip in Linux) is a
producer, not a consumer.

This patch is not about assigning initial values to GPIO lines.
That is an orthogonal usecase. This is just about naming lines.

+Optionally, a GPIO controller may have a "gpio-names" property. This is
+an array of strings defining the names of the GPIO lines going out of the
+GPIO controller. This name should be the most meaningful producer name
+for the system, such as a rail name indicating the usage. Package names
+such as pin name are discouraged: such lines have opaque names (since they
+are by definition generic purpose) and such names are usually not very
+helpful. For example "MMC-CD", "Red LED Vdd" and "ethernet reset" are
+reasonable line names as they describe what the line is used for. "GPIO0"
+is not a good name to give to a GPIO line. Placeholders are discouraged:
+rather use the "" (blank string) if the use of the GPIO line is undefined
+in your design. The names are assigned starting from line offset 0 from
+left to right from the passed array. An incomplete array (where the number
+of passed named are less than ngpios) will still be used up until the last
+provided valid line index.
