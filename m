Yes, I understand why you want to design it this way, but don't design
your bindings around how 1 OS happens to currently work.

That doesn't look appended to me. The documentation says it should
look like this:

compatible = "atmel,sama5d2-secumod", "syscon";

Is it a separate h/w block and do you have other child nodes that need
their own resources in DT (interrupts, clocks, etc.)? If these aren't
the case, then no you shouldn't. As it stands, you don't have any
other child nodes, so no you shouldn't have a child node here. Just
add to properties to the existing binding:

secumod@fc040000 {
        compatible = "atmel,sama5d2-secumod", "syscon";
        reg = <0xfc040000 0x100>;
        #gpio-cells = <2>;
        gpio-controller;
};

Now perhaps you have 10 other functions in this block like pinctrl,
clocks, phys, power domains, etc. Then child nodes would be warranted.
But if that's the case, then please write a complete binding for the
secumod block.

Sounds like an OS problem that has little to do with the binding. In
any case, if you change a binding which you have, then it needs to be
documented.

If it has one, then yes you should. If it doesn't then it is probably
not a separate h/w block and shouldn't have a child node to begin
with.
