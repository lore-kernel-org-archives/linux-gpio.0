Some platforms (e.g: Broadcom STB: BMIPS_GENERIC/ARCH_BRCMSTB) will lose
their register contents when entering their lower power state. In such a
case, the pinctrl-single driver that is used will not be able to restore
the power states without telling the core about it and having
pinctrl_select_state() check for that.

This patch adds a new optional boolean property that Device Tree can
define in order to obtain exactly that and having the core pinctrl code
take that into account.
