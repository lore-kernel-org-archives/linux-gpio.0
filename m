Sorry for being late for the discussion.

To be honest, I did not really expect so many i.MX6 variants coming to
us.  Just out of curiosity, are there any more in the pipeline to come,
or is this the last known one?

I understand that there are now more generic support available at
pinctrl core level for us to use than the time we initial designed i.MX
pinctrl driver.  But I intend to agree with Jacky that imx6sll can be
supported by the existing driver, since it doesn't require any
additional driver changes.

If any new generation of i.MX family require changes on the existing
pinctrl driver, we should probably push back for a redesign to use
generic support as much as possible.  @Jacky, how does i.MX8 pinctrl
look like?  How same or different as/from i.MX6 pinctrl?

Just my opinion.
