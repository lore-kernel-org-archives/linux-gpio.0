Sure, only the reason for that was that there are situations where
subsys_initcall() was too late. Also, when using arch_initcall() only,
we get deferrals again, which is apparently hated by many and a reason
for all those "avoid probe deferrals" patches.

... except for others it isn't, and we are back to square one.

GPIO_WATCHDOG_ARCH_INITCALL was intended to be only used in situations
where needed. Why is it used here in the first place if that is not
the case ?
