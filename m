Sounds good to me!

I thought even with your patch we still call of_find_node_by_phandle on
each (phandle) cell as we go over the property, before we hit the check
for cells_name?

Given that of_find_node_by_phandle does a pretty naive linear search of
the of_allnodes list, that could get significant, especially if all the
elements referred to in the property are near the end of the of_allnodes
list.

A Likely story... :)

Thanks,
