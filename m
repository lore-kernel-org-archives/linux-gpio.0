Aha it is a consumer configuration thing, then I see it.

I think it seems a bit odd that it is assumed that the default is that
we should *not* preserve the GPIO output value if we go to sleep.
Should the flag be inverted?

Also, why can't we just use a generic flag for this, it seems very
very generic.

Look in:
include/dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h

Is there any reasons why we can't have:
/* Bit 3 express GPIO suspend/resume persistance in low power mode */
#define GPIO_MUST_KEEP_VALUE 0
#define GPIO_MAY_LOOSE_VALUE_DURING_SLEEP 8

Yeah it's talkative but informative. This way you can mark up lines
that are OK to loose their value during low-power/sleep using
just (new) standard bindings that can be reused by others,
also optionally making it possible for the gpiolib core to take action
on these properties if need be.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
