Hmmmmmm. OK shall we hold this driver until the infrastructure
issues are resolved?

The following is a recurring pattern among GPIO controllers:
the GPIO controller can go offline (asycnhcronous) and while it
is offline a secondary logic triggers an IRQ that wakes the system
up, however the GPIO logic cannot really "see" that IRQ since
it was sleeping when it arrived.

Thus a latent IRQ is pending in the wakeup logic. This concept
exists in drivers/pinctrl/nomadik/pinctrl-nomadik.c and I strongly
prefer to call these "latent irqs" as it's a clear unambigous
terminology.

So is this a case of latent IRQs pending in the GIC?

Yours,
