How to? It's just connected to ttyS and after apply power it has to be =

But we don't need anything else just raw named gpio.

Maybe I didn't give good example.
There is a board. It has 8 outputs. They are relay outputs. Let's give =
them
rel0 - 7 name. And user can same of them use for valve, some for light.=
=2E.
Ant board has 8 inputs. They are optocoupler isolated. And user can som=

them use to get water level, light...

So making some kind of device "inout" wold be good idea?
