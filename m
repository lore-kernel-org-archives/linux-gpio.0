For our case the irq_domain is in irq-gic driver, the GPIO driver only
is responsible to wire 2 the external irq of GIC to GPIO pin.

Example for configure GPIO_DS13 as interrupt and use as button with
the current gpio driver:
        gpio-keys {
                compatible = "gpio-keys";
                button@1 {
                        label = "POWER";
                        linux,code = <116>;
                        linux,input-type = <0x1>;
                        interrupts = <0x0 0x2d 0x1>;
                };
        };

Do you mean #gpio-cells property and using the high bit of the second
bit for irq/input  ?
