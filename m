It's quite complex, but your implementation is so crisp and clean
that there is nothing to complain about really.

We are discussing putting some hierarchy handling into the
gpiolib core, so you might want to simplify the code later to
make use of this, but for now it's perfectly fine.

Patch applied.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
