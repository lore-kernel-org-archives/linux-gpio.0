They both belong to arch_initicall level, aren't they? So ordering is guarded
only by having customize_machine(which calls init_machine) from arch/arm/kernel/
before sa1100_init from arch/arm/mach-sa1100/?

For sa1100 there are only 2.5 platforms which use gpiolib - collie and h3xxx.
(The half is for simpad, which registers gpio chip from platform code, but
doesn't use it otherwise -- in platform code, of course).

Collie is changed not to call gpio_to_irq at init_machine time.
Separate patchset
reworks h3xxx (I missed them first time) to call gpio_* functions later.
