Nah, we have a few hard cases.

The most annoying one is with regulators, those need to grab the
same GPIO line several times and use in parallel. It is a valid case,
so we need a way to get GPIO descriptors non-execlusively for these
so we can deal with it properly.

Then there is a bunch of cases where it's simpler, those are low-hanging
fruit. Like the conversion of backlight on GPIO I sent recently. They just
need being churned out one by one.
