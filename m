I agree that there's not much functionality from a user's perspective,
but the "kicking the can down the road" assessment might be a little
harsh. Given the lack of user functionality it becomes more difficult
to argue for the patch's inclusion given the additional complexity, but
it does mean that the g4/g5 drivers can completely specify their
dependencies and not have the aspeed pinctrl core do the wrong thing
when it encounters the non-SCU IP offsets. It gets us half-way to
having the pinctrl driver actually configure the state (knowing what it
needs to configure), which I feel is more than a kick-the-can-down-the-
road boondoggle.

So if we accept that a proper solution includes specifying the off-SCU
dependencies, the remaining question is how do we tastefully apply the
desired state on register-spaces the pinctrl driver doesn't own.

Or failing that, an approach that is acceptable...

Cheers,
