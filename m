Feel free to contribute a tool to tools/gpio that perform what you
need from scripts, using a chardev.

But overall it is subject to the same issue as always: we open
a chardev and hold it to keep references to it even if the hardware
goes away. Scripting doesn't seem supergood at opening chardevs
and holding them and are thus inherently fragile.

With a chardev we can handle that gracefully.

As it is right now, files in sysfs can just disappear while your script
is running (if e.g. the GPIO is on a USB device or so) and then all
hell breaks loose I think. So it is very fragile.

See commit fe95046e960b4b76e73dc1486955d93f47276134
it is deprecated but will be around until (at least) 2020.

The chardev will be promoted as it is *always* available, whereas
the sysfs has a Kconfig option you must switch on.

We have this for in-kernel consumers (<linux/gpio/consumer.h>):

/**
 * Optional flags that can be passed to one of gpiod_* to configure direction
 * and output value. These values cannot be OR'd.
 */
enum gpiod_flags {
        GPIOD_ASIS      = 0,
        GPIOD_IN        = GPIOD_FLAGS_BIT_DIR_SET,
        GPIOD_OUT_LOW   = GPIOD_FLAGS_BIT_DIR_SET | GPIOD_FLAGS_BIT_DIR_OUT,
        GPIOD_OUT_HIGH  = GPIOD_FLAGS_BIT_DIR_SET | GPIOD_FLAGS_BIT_DIR_OUT |
                          GPIOD_FLAGS_BIT_DIR_VAL,
};

We have not yet specified a proper ABI for usespace. Are these
flags the same as you would want for userspace?

My feeling is that unless specified ASIS is what you want.

Especially if there is also an ABI to read the line value.

Let's get the chardev right in this regard and use that.

Well maybe we should have an ABI specifying what state we
want it to be left in, if e.g. the userspace application either quit
without saying anything, or more importantly, if it crashes.

With the chardev we can do that.

Drivers can do pretty much what they want, they are supposed
to handle the hardware as well as they can. They might be doing this
for a reason or not, better ask the driver writers and/or send them
patches to augment the behaviour.
