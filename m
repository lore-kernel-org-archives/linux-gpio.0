OK, I make single line print for OTP and ES version.
I remove the NVREC reading and printing as this is read on clear and 
better to move on uboot for this prints.

In one of my design,  I have three PMICs, one MAX77620, two MAX77621. 
MAX77621 alert an MAX77620 interrupt line is tied and going to single 
interrupt of SoC.

To register same interrupt from all driver, I made it SHARED.

This is per discussion on the other patch
regulator: max8973: add support for junction thermal warning

In my 3rd patch, I tried to align it little more where is possible. But 
I feel that all these indenting is more over individual choice. Example, 
I added one more indent in below example to look better.


         ret = max77620_reg_update(chip->dev, MAX77620_PWR_SLAVE,
-               MAX77620_REG_ONOFFCNFG2, MAX77620_ONOFFCNFG2_WK_EN0,
-               MAX77620_ONOFFCNFG2_WK_EN0);
+                       MAX77620_REG_ONOFFCNFG2, MAX77620_ONOFFCNFG2_WK_EN0,
+                       MAX77620_ONOFFCNFG2_WK_EN0);
