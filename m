Good catch! Now I see why this was acting so weird for you.
Also the MFD semantics are standardized and make much more
sense after this.

Reviewed-by: Linus Walleij <linus.walleij@linaro.org>

I suppose Lee can merge this in orthogonal in the MFD tree,
the end result will be functional after the v5.1 merge window.

I think I should also fix qcom-pm8xxx after this, as well as
the similar SSBI code for elder platforms.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
