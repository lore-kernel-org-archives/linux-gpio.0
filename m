This patch looks VERY good to me.

I am fine in merging it into pin control including the ranges
fixes.

I need Andy's and Bjorn's ACKs on it though!

Can you guys provide that?

It might be that Andy want the DTS changes separately to avoid
any collisions, so I'm fine with splitting it as well.

Yours,
