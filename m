If we modify the existing one then that work will be outside of this 
series to make it independent.

However, the file name does not suggest common in older file. Also this 
will require mfd and rtc driver changes to decouple it.

Here is my approach:
- Let's have common driver in implementation and file name. This will be 
independent of the mfd driver on all sense.
- Once it is merged, move the max77686 and max77802 to use this driver, 
this will need the modification on the mfd driver, related defconfig 
file and if specific stuff needed in the rtc then addition of that.

Per your approach:
- Modify rtc max77686 and mfd driver max77686 to decouple and proper 
registration.
- Add support of max77620 on the max77686 driver if any specific is 
required.

That is also fine to me but still I am not comfortable with the config 
name and driver file name as this does not suggest the common.
