The SCI is just IRQ 9 - it tells the OS that there's a firmware event, 
but in itself doesn't say what that event was. This is handled by the 
platform setting bits in the GPE*_STS registers. The ACPI code reads 
that and then dispatches the event to the appropriate handler. This will 
typically be some ACPI code (declared by _Lxx and _Exx methods in the 
ACPI tables - xx corresponds to the GPE number, L and E whether it's 
level or edge triggered), but in some cases you want to install a 
hardcoded event handler.

I've only got the 5-series docs to hand, and I can't remember whether 
that's Panther Point, but you want to look at the definition of GPE0_STS 
to figure out which hardware events cause which GPEs. GPEs 16 to 31 
appear to correspond to GPIO 0 to 15, which is easy enough to handle.

Ok. As long as you don't reprogram anything by default, I think this 
should be fine.
