I don't understand what makes GPIO's "special" enough to get included in
the driver core like this, and called for each and every device that is
added to the system.

What's wrong with the generic device callbacks/notifiers we already
have?  Why does this need to be in the driver core?  And what exactly
are you doing all of this for in the first place?
