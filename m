I will try to answer this. This IP is indeed a GPIO block
but the IO's are used just OUTPUT lines from Linux
HOST perspective. These IOs are connected to the DSPs
as input/IRQ lines. The DSP-ARM host IPC mechanism used on
Keystone is Linux user-space based and it does as one of the
component.

Its not mailbox since there is no payload etc attached to it.
GPIO lib does expose the IO's to userspace and thats what is
being the case here. I think it is a legitimate usecase.

Sometimes the sending signals to another co-processor might
appear like shoehorning or odd but it just uses standard
GPIO library and its capabilities as is.
