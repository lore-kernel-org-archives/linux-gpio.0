Hi Linus,

I'd like to get this patchset merged, but I'm aware that we haven't yet
received additional ACKs in the past couple months. Are there any
changes you would like made, or should I resubmit this patchset with
additional CCs in the hopes of some ACKs for the bitops patch?

Sincerely,

William Breathitt Gray
