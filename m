Oh, ick.  The binding has a compatible string in the individual
regulator bindings which is broken unless there really are lots of
variants being configured via DT (which is just not the case here).
It's not only more typing in the DT, it also means that we can't read
back the configuration of the device unless the user goes and creates a
DT which explicitly lists each regulator on the device which is
unhelpful.  We should be able to read back the configurations of all the
regulators by simply listing the device in DT.

The fact that this is different to the bindings for other regulator
drivers and requires more code ought to have been a big warning sign
here :(
