Each of the db0-gpios and db1-gpios is already an array with one pin for
each chip in the daisy-chain.

So it would have to be a two-dimensional array, which AFAICS is not
supported by the devicetree spec, or is it?

However I realize that for clarity I should amend fault-gpios, db0-gpios
and db1-gpios with the same text as modesel-gpios:
			The number of GPIOs must be equal to "maxim,nchips".

I'd have to look at the regulator's current voltage to determine through
which pin the chips in the daisy-chain are powered (5VOUT or VCC24V).

But if the regulator is generating 5V I couldn't discern if it's a
faulting 24V supply or a non-faulting 5V supply.

So a boolean does seem necessary, however I realize now that "no-vcc24v"
is misleading, I've changed it to "maxim,ignore-undervoltage" for clarity:

- maxim,ignore-undervoltage:
			Boolean, whether to ignore undervoltage alarms signaled
			by the "maxim,fault-gpios" and by the status byte
			(in 16-bit mode).  Use this if the chips are powered
			through 5VOUT instead of VCC24V, in which case they
			will constantly signal undervoltage.

Thanks,

Lukas
