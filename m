Yeah option 3 is the primary issue here, we only want to keep the
CODEC enabled whilst specific GPIOs are in use. As GPIOs can be
dynamically requested/released by things in the kernel we want to
know which GPIOs require the CODEC to be kept alive. Also in the
future one might be tempted to add maintain whilst high and
maintain whilst low options for lines with pulls on them to
further optimise power.
