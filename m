Hi Linus,

thanks for the reply!

I know what you mean, check commit acd316248205 ;-)

But in the Allwinner case all the firmware is open source, and even
controlled by the community (ATF & U-Boot). This is even more true for
the DT. Allwinner came up with their own DT, but since it uses
completely non-standard bindings, we don't use it at all.

So I don't consider firmware this dark, evil and unhackable blob that
many people see in it. Instead it is a good opportunity to separate very
tedious machine-specific parts from the kernel (think of PSCI).

I agree!

On the other hand a lot of the ACPI tables have been either taken from
x86 or designed also with Windows in mind. And frankly, my sympathy for
MS is quite limited in this respect ;-)

I am sure one can find clever hac^Wsolutions for this problem, but I was
wondering if a new approach - like putting the per machine data actually
in DT - isn't the smarter way.
Hence my suggestion with this driver: we *need* the DT anyway to assign
pins to devices, so why not just add the few bytes *there*, which allows
us to have a more or less "data-less" DT driver?

>From what I learned the pinctrl subsystem seems to predates the ARM DT
endeavor, so many design decisions probably didn't consider DT as a
possible solution in the first way. And this is fine, because this is
how it was back then. But it doesn't mean it has to stay this way. And I
carefully thought of solving this problem without alienating existing
users and developers - by keeping the driver and staying compatible with
the existing binding and the DTs.

Yes, this, but also to avoid replicating data in other DT consumers. I
very much like the idea of the DT describing the hardware, but I am a
bit afraid we loose many good opportunities by treating the DT more like
a "Linux config file" or an external Linux board file.
So I wanted to propose a way where we simplify DT usage in other
systems, while still keeping the Linux driver intact.

So to keep Maxime happy I actually designed this "driver" more like a
shim: to generate the table the current driver expects from the DT, and
actually not touching the existing driver at all.
So maintainability should actually be less of a concern: the driver will
just work with whatever one throws at it from the DT side, without
requiring frequent changes or additions.
In the moment we still need to write, review and merge *data* files for
each new SoC. And as I mentioned before, Allwinner decided to push for
new, slightly different chips every few months, so there will be more to
come. With at least the pinctrl driver out of the way we have one
problem less to worry about.

Cheers,
Andre.
