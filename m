Thanks for the explanation. I suppose sunxi falls into the "don't
care" group. We mainly enforce proper use cases through the DT
pinmux settings. Of course this doesn't prevent the user from
using weird settings out of tree, but then again what's preventing
them from hacking the kernel anyway.

Back to my original question: is it possible to drop the pin group
support completely? Looking at struct pinctrl_ops the answer seems
to be no.
