Because I don't 'depend' on REGMAP_I2C, I 'select' it. So none of its
dependencies need be met, so I have to depend on them for REGMAP_I2C.

'Depending' on REGMAP_I2C would also be undesirable as my symbol would
only be visible when REGMAP_I2C is =y, this would obscure my symbol as
no one would know to turn on REGMAP_I2C to make my driver appear. I
only need I2C and then I can go manually enable all my random helper
symbols myself if I'm selected.

To me it seems like a fundamental issue with how the Kconfig system
was originally designed (a quick check shows it existed in some form
20 years ago...) that leads to this kind of thing, if they knew how
it would be used today they probably would have made it more
directed-tree like, without the reverse dependencies and all.

Well sure, they have been a lot of help for core config where I might
not know what CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS means and a long explanation is nice,
but I know what a TPS65086 is, if I didn't I wouldn't be trying to
enable the driver for it.

I'll see what I can think up. "These include voltage regulators, GPIO
and other features that are often used in portable devices." Really
does give the gist of it for uninformed users who might want to know
why this is enabled for their computer/board.

Honestly I don't think the part actually does anything else, but saying
that when other similar parts add the "other features" line is kinda
odd and might single out this part as looking less useful.
