GPIOs in hardware may be routed to devices logically in groups of I/O
lines, yet must still be accessed via the word-sized registers on the
operating machine.

For example, suppose a GPIO card is used to control a set of shower
devices. The card supports 4 shower devices, each device controlled by 3
lines of I/O: enable, hot-cold selection, high-low pressure selection.
In this case, a operating machine would still have to access the GPIO
lines via the I/O registers (e.g. 8-bit port I/O); but with a macro
handling a clump size of 3-bits, we can loop logically by each shower
device which is much simpler from a driver perspective.
