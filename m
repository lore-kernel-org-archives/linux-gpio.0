Pantelis,

Thanks for the feedback.

I think in this instance the nodes are explicitly defining hogs.
Please clarify. What would you like to see here?

The original patch was allowing that but, Linus's review comment sugges=
ted this feature be=20
part of the gpio-controller's gpiochip_add() hook only.

Again this follows Linus's review comment.
I agree that it prevent a centralize spot where all hog would be define=
d but it has the advantages of not relying on PROBE_DEFER.
I mean since all "gpio-hogs" would be defined in a single board dts fil=
e it would not be that hard to figure out the big picture anyways.
