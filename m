Yeah but since pinctrl and pinmux has its own debugfs files why is this
necessary? I understand it is convenient but only for debugging
right? They the inconvenience of using pinctrls debugfs files should
be bearable.

Also it is possible for any GPIO chip to implement its own
debug print if they like, check what we do in
->dbg_show in drivers/pinctrl/nomadik/pinctrl-nomadik.c
for example.

If the use is for debug prints, keep it driver-local.

NAK why would be encourage the non-descriptor interface by
adding to it? Better only offer this to the descriptor users.
