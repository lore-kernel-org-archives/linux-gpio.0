The problem is that gpiochip_add_pin_range() was not intended for
DT-based pinctrls... but it got used anyway.

This topic came up in an earlier post:
"Re: pinctrl: qcom: ipq4019: Use of gpio-hog's" [0] (you must have gotten
this mail too, since you are on the Cc.) which links to a ML thread titled
"Re: [GIT PULL] SPEAr pinctrl updates for v-3.5" 

For your convenience: (this post is from 2012-09-03 - so it's 5-6 years
old by now and it looks like it predates even the DT pinctrl-msm driver.
(Not entirely sure?))

I think you must have come across similar issues with the
"gpio-reserved-ranges" property you recently added. Because
from what I can glimpse from the
"[2/3] dt-bindings: pinctrl: Add a ngpios-ranges property" 
<https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10153785/> series.
The gpio-reserved-ranges property would also need to be added
to existing products (msm8996) as well, right?
("I stuck this inside msm8996, but maybe it can go somewhere more generic?")

The pinctrl-msm.c driver will fallback to using gpiochip_add_pin_range(),
if the gpio-ranges property is not present. So all existing and compiled 
devicetree binaries files will remain compatible.

As for adding the gpio-ranges to the dt binding text files under
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/: Sure. No problem. I can add
them too :).

But I do have a question: Should I also include the missing declaration
of the gpio-reserved-ranges properties too? (I can make the patches over
the long weekend. If I hear nothing from anyone, I'll post them on Monday).

(Also, it looks like the nvidia tegra pinctrl-driver has the gpio-ranges
property in the DTS, but not in the binding documentation. I'll add
that to the nvidia pile.)

Thanks,
Christian
