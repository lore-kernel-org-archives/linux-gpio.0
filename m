Btw, I saw that imx7d-sdb.dts (and probably other i.MX 7 boards too) use
three different settings for usdhc pinctrl: 0x59, 0x5a and 0x5b (for
default, 100MHz and 200MHz respectively). One would expect that higher
frequency use higher driver strength (and this is the case for i.MX 6).
But with this new/corrected pad values this means we use x4, x2 and x6
for default, 100MHz and 200MHz respectively. This hardly seems right..?
Probably needs fixing too?
