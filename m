Yeah I know. I am battling with this, it is one of those topics
where you feel "eeeehhhh" and try to avoid looking at it. Sadly
I have to...

I refer to Documentation/ManagementStyle, chapter 1,
"Decisions".

What makes me feel uneasy about these things is that the decisions
are irreversible due to the nature of the device tree bindings.

I am not a manager, but a maintainer...

So is it universally agreed that the changes are harmless?

If they are harmless, I would be able to revert the patch and
nothing breaks in the world, I don't think that is the case. The
case is a piece of code and functionality that is not AT91-specific
but has to be maintained in the core pinctrl code forever.

That is basically the big problem with anything device tree.
It etches stuff in stone so it can't be changed, like ever.
Further, the decision on whether to etch this or that is
pushed to Linux subsystem maintainers, who are clearly
unsuited for the task. :(

I'm sorry, I am just trying to wait for consensus but it seems to
be hard for that to happen.

Things I need:

- More DT bindings people to look at this patch.

- More other driver maintainers to look at this patch.
  Sacha is one of those I'd like to get an opinion from
  for example. ACKs, Reviewed-by's are always good.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
