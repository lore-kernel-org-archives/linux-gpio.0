Sorry, I was wrong. I had misread the documentation.

There are 18 pins. 15 pins are common between LCD and NAND. The QPIC 
controller arbitrates between LCD and NAND. Of the remaining 4, 2 are 
for NAND and 2 are for LCD exclusively. We plan to group the qpic pins 
into 3 groups namely, qpic_common, qpic_nand and qpic_lcd. Is that ok?

Thanks
