This patchset adds a driver support for Cadence GPIO controller.

Number of supported lines is configurable.
The driver initializes all pins as inputs in probe().
Currently it only supports level-sensitive interrupts.

The interrupts controller was tested with I2C and SPI IPs
acting as interrupt sources.

Changes since V2:
	Added spinlocks in request, free and irq_set_type functions.

Changes since V1:
	Switched to generic GPIO infrastructure.
	Redesigned interrupts, now uses chained irqchip.
	Drop support for edge-sensitive interrupts.
	Restore bypass settings at unexport/remove.
