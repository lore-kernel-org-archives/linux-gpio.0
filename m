I'm not sure about the driver thing in Windows in the case of _ADR
devices to be honest.  That said, by the spec you're only supposed to
use _ADR with things listed in Table 6-168 (page 278) as of ACPI 6.
So that already is a stretch to use _ADR for something not listed
there.

The fact that this is an integer rather than a name is slightly
problematic too, because it does not fit into some use cases we
already have drivers for.  In some cases the "child" entities are
referred to by names, because things have been developed with DT in
mind.  We generally would like to avoid having to provide a separate
ACPI code path at least in some of those cases if possible.

As for the overhead, if something is a device object, it already has a
scope associated with it in the ACPI namespace which adds complexity.
Further, we create a struct acpi_device for it, which is based on
struct device and registered with the driver core etc.  All of those
things are not small objects so they take up quite a bit of memory.
Not to mention sysfs interfaces created for them and so on.  They also
are taken into account by things like acpi_walk_namespace() and
generally cause those operations to be slightly slower.  The are taken
into account by the system suspend/resume code too.

In those cases you may need to use device objects, but you can still
do that just fine.  It is just more heavy-weight and may be
problematic for other OSes at least in principle, so by doing that you
may end up with Linux-specific firmware.

The new mechanism introduced here is for the situations in which you
don't have to do that and by using it you can avoid having to worry
about things like the Windows PnP manager entirely.

I don't see why you can't do that (except that the paths need to be
represented as strings and they are relative to the current scope by
default, so here they need to be absolute or use the "one level up"
operator).

Well, you are.

Why exactly does that matter?

Yes, they have to be strings.

We attempted to use references for that, but those are replaced with
the target objects in some cases when the package is being created.

That only is possible at run time when the namespace has been created
(think about stuff coming from different SSDTs, for example).

That is recommended even. :-)

No problem at all.  Please let me know if the above is sufficient.
