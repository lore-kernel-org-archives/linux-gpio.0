I think we can do the merging of max77802 and max77686 at second step.

At first, lets decouple the rtc-max77686.c with its mfd driver. This 
will give better picture how will it be done.
Once this is there then max77620 can use this and in parallel, can be 
work for max77802 to use the same driver.


Let's first conclude and get accpepted for max77686 and max77620 as both 
of us have related HW to verify the changes.
