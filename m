This is the patch series for TPS68470 PMIC that works as a camera PMIC.

The patch series provide the following 3 drivers, to help configure
the voltage regulators, clocks and GPIOs provided by the TPS68470
PMIC, to be able to use the camera sensors connected to this PMIC.

TPS68470 MFD driver:
This is the multi function driver that initializes the TPS68470
PMIC and supports the GPIO and Op Region functions.

TPS68470 GPIO driver:
This is the PMIC GPIO driver that will be used by the OS GPIO layer,
when the BIOS / firmware triggered GPIO access is done.

TPS68470 Op Region driver:
This is the driver that will be invoked, when the BIOS / firmware
configures the voltage / clock for the sensors / vcm devices
connected to the PMIC.

Changes in v3:
	- MFD driver:
	- Removed GPIO lookup table
	- Reverted to probe() for consistency
	- Addressed other comments from Andy

	- GPIO driver:
	- Removed the code that initializes the default values
	  of GPIOs to zeros
	- Used gpiochip_get_data() to access data inside the gpio_chip
 
Changes in v2:
	- MFD driver:
	- Removed tps68470_* wrappers around regmap_* calls
	- Removed "struct tps68470"
	- used devm_mfd_add_devices and removed mutex in mfd driver
	- Added reasoning about the need of having mfd driver
	  as bool/builtin

	- Opregion driver:
	- renamed opregion driver file / internal symbol names
	  with tps68470_pmic*
	- Made opregion driver tables as const
	- Removed unused *handler_context in common handler
	- Replaced "int" with "unsigned int"
	- Changed to WARN macro to dev_warn()
	- Destroyed mutex on error
	- Added reasoning about the need of having Opregion driver
	  as bool/builtin
	
	- GPIO driver:
	- Implemented get_direction() in the GPIO driver
	- Setup gpio_chip.names
	- Moved the GPIO lookup table code inside mfd driver
	- Added reasoning about the need of having GPIO driver
	  as bool/builtin
