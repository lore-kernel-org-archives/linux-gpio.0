Leaving that blunt hack aside:

import mraa

pin = mraa.Gpio(13)
pin.dir(mraa.DIR_OUT)
pin.write(1)

And the same goes for nodejs, java and c++.

Moreover, this allows you to abstract away where "Pin 13" actually came from on 
that board if the kernel changes (BSP -> upstream...) or the extension board or 
... We will exploit that when moving to a completely different base hardware 
with the next revision or our IOT2000.

You also have to keep the class of "cool, I've just created my first Node.RED 
node!" IoT newbies in mind. These higher abstraction help to keep them away from 
the wrong lower APIs - or enable them to do something at all ("Cool, I've just 
connected my first two nodes!"). By far not all of them have consultants at hand.

And while we only ship our IOT2000 image with mraa and all the fun as reference 
image, it's way more for quite a few users. Even if you do not want to look 
behind the curtains of certain software components (that we primarily inherited 
and then started to clean up), they are working, or we would have heard.
