I missed it I will do it in v4.

As you probably noticed pinctrl and gpio register are mixed in this
hardware. One of the register is alos use to get some clock freqeuncy,
so that's why I ended with a syscon node. The parent node is the
pinctrl. My main motivation to use a subnode was to be ablee to have a
phandle associated with the GPIO chip. In my first version I only have
one node but then I realized that I could not use GPIO in the device
tree without an phandle to point it.

If you have an other solution, I would be happy to remove this subnode.

There won't be a second gpio-controllers because we only have one gpio
controller by pin controller (as they are actually the same). Also as I
said above, the subnode is mainly here to provide a phandle.

But I can add a comment to emphasize it.

I think I can.

It was done in the v3.
