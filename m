You shouldn't need to install an SCI handler - the way the hardware will 
generate an SCI is to raise a GPE. If you know which GPE the device 
raises (my recollection is that for most Intel chipsets it's GPIO number 
+ 0x10) then you can just call acpi_install_gpe_handler(). The problem 
is that the firmware may well already be using some of those GPIOs, and 
there's no easy way to tell. Checking the interrupt configuration isn't 
sufficient, since some of them may just be used as outputs.
