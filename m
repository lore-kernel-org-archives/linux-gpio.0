Hi Chen-Yu,

thanks for the patch! I tried to apply it on the pinctrl devel branch
(for v5.1) but it failed to apply, I assume because it depends on
the fixes that I just sent to Torvalds.

Shall we proceed like this that I merge v5.0-rc6 as soon as it is
out and then try to apply this on top of that instead, so we get
rid of this conflict?

Yours,
Linus Walleij
