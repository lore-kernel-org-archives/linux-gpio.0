Why can't the application use something else than raw GPIOs? Don't you
have its source code?

This sounds pretty much like you are asking to register
application-specific configuration into the DT.

Shouldn't that be fixed in the pinmux/GPIO kernel drivers? I am not
too familiar with pinmux, but IIUC pixmux configuration when GPIOs are
requested is something that is commonly done.

That we definitely agree, and as of today there are many ways to do thi=
s:
1) A dedicated driver that exposes exactly the right interface to
sysfs. I know it may seem overkill, but we have drivers for other
simple things like GPIO-controlled LEDs.
2) If you think writing a driver is not worth the effort, you can
already export and configure (and I'm willing to discuss the
possibility to add "give names" to that list) GPIOs, from user-space.

I understand that you want to keep the GPIO exporting/configuration
from the DT to have all the board-specific settings in one place, but
my understanding of the device tree is that it is supposed to say "I
have a garage door control device connected to this GPIO", not "export
this GPIO as input active-low, and name it GARAGE_DOOR".

Could you maybe point me to references of the hardware (both the
devices connected to the GPIOs and the board itself if the specs are
available) so I can understand the issue fully?

In that case my problem is precisely that there is no kernel driver.

Anyway, the first question to answer is "is it reasonable to export
and configure GPIOs from the Device Tree", and it concerns the DT
maintainers mostly ; so let's hear what they think about this first.
