This is not properly described as pin config parameters, but that is how
they are used in the driver. Please describe that this is supposed to
augment the pin config of the pins.

But I think it looks bogus. If the pins are already mixed to groups
like that:

OK so what the "special properties" above indicates is really the
direction of the pins, whether out (master) or in (slave".

Just use the standard bool pin config properties:
input-enable;
output-enable;

Reference
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt

For this. If you want users to see that this is master and slave,
just /* Write a comment */ in the device tree.
