Hi Stephen

STMPE family is GPIO expander, and for some of them, it includes others 
fonctionnality:
     _STMPE811 and STMPE610: touchscreen controller
     _ STMPE1601, STMPE2401 and STMPE2403: keypad and PWM controller
     _ STMPE1801: keypad controller

For more informations, some datasheets are available here: 
http://www2.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/interfaces-and-transceivers/i-o-expanders-and-level-translators/i-o-expanders.html?querycriteria=productId=SC1027

drivers/mfd/stmpe.c and drivers/gpio/gpio-stmpe.c are drivers which 
support all STMPE variant.
I put you in copy as STMPE811 is used on tegra30-apalis and 
tegra30-colibri platforms.

Thanks

Patrice
