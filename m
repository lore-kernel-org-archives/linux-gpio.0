To be frank, I took the IRQ code from the GPIO driver verbatim, and only tested
a simple use case on beagle bone black.
The interrupt code is very complex and sincerely I was not able to understand
clearly how it worked.

The IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH did work for me since the BBB irq controller dealt with it.

I will dig in the datasheet and run more uses cases next week, but since the
code hasn't changed since the GPIO driver, so this is a nice to have !

Andrey, can we talk over irc somehow ? I'm idling as narmstrong on freenode.
