I agree about not using compatible in regulator nodes (Mark Brown and I had
a discussion on this topic), what I mean with "xxxxxxx-pmic" is for the MFD
core to match sub-drivers (mfd_cells). For example drivers/mfd/tps80031.c,
matches the regulator with "tps80031-pmic", the clock with "tps80031-clock",
the charger with "tps80031-charger", etc..

The core device itself is just matched with "ti,tps65086" through the I2C bus
matching.

I could change the core to be "tps65086-pmic", then call the regulator
driver "tps65086-regulator" if this works for you, this seems to be the
way new drivers name the regulator driver (max77843.c).
