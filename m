Except clock-names is the consumer side. There is clock-output-names
for the clock controller side though.

Arguably, the names you have are the consumer side. The consumer side
is what defines the function. The consumer name is typically local
like vddio being the input supply pin, but the producer names are more
global like ldo3.

It is unless we decide that both should use the same structure.

I'm also worried that just putting in somewhat random names doesn't
buy much. If you have to figure out what the name is for the GPIO line
you want from userspace, then you might as well know the chip and
offset. I'm doubtful we could standardize naming across platforms.

I'm not saying yes or no yet, just raising some of the concerns I have.
