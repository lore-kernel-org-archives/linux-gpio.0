This is inside the SoC, right, not outside it?

In the rest of my answer I assume this.

If this is on the board, using enable-gpios is proper.

I would point to "GPIO mode pitfalls" in
Documentation/driver-api/pinctl.rst

If the construction above is inside the SoC, this line is just called
"GPIO" out of habit.

Think about it: is it really "general purpose input/output"?
It looks more like "special purpose, output-only, RX-enable line".

The only reason it is called "GPIO" is because the bit activating
it happens to be inside some silicon block that the hardware
engineer calls "GPIO", but it is not GPIO.

I would definately try to set it up as part of the pin control state
in the device tree like you illustrate, and not use the enable-gpios
at all.

Possibly, if this bit also appears in a generic GPIO block with a bunch
of other GPIOs you need to mask off this GPIO from generic use
if you want to be pedantic about things. But generally we just leave
that kind of things open for the developer so they can freely
shoot themselves in the foot with it.

Yours,
