I don't see any problem with this patch set so I have merged it
into an immutable branch in my GPIO tree, and if it builds fine
I will merge it for devel (for-v5.1).

Notably we do not add a userspace ABI in this patch series.

I guess that is fine for now, but I think we might see userspace
support requests soon. But that can be a different patch
and should be driven by actual need for that.
