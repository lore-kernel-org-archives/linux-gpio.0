Considering how small the driver is, I'm not sure if I'd say it's a 
"huge" diff.

Frankly, I think this is a very elegant re-purposing of 'npins'.

So you want the request callback to propagated to the SOC driver?  I 
guess that could work.

Well, now I'm confused.  First I thought you wanted to move the valid 
check into pinctrl-qdf2xxx, but now you say you want it done in 
pinctrl-msm, but isn't that what my patches are doing now?

If the pin can't be requested, doesn't that take care of IRQ lines 
automatically?  I don't touch the irq_valid_mask code.

Well, I really didn't want to do that.  Keep in mind that the root 
problem is getting pinctrl-qdf2xxx to be able to tell pinctrl-msm what 
pins are valid.  That is the bulk of my code.

I'm understanding you less and less the more I read.

I do not understand that.  To be honest, I think I already have the 
simplest solution, at least for ACPI.  I don't really want to complicate 
my patches to support DT, since I don't really know what the DT-specific 
problems are.

I don't care about pin muxing, but my patches already take care of debugfs.

Frankly, I thought I had everything resolved already, and it sounds like 
you want me to start over from scratch anyway.
