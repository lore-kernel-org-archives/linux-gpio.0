Hi,

I'm currently trying to use rfkill-gpio with a device that has just a
single GPIO assigned by ACPI. rfkill-gpio calls acpi_dev_add_driver_gpi=
os
to assign names to the ACPI GPIOs and then uses devm_gpiod_get_optional
to request both of them. The problem is that on the second call to
devm_gpiod_get_optional acpi_find_gpio falls back to using the GPIO ind=
ex
0 (from gpiod_get) in _CRS, which leads to the same GPIO being returned
as in the first call. Probing the driver then fails with -EBUSY.

In my opinion it is a bad idea to fall back to indexing the _CRS if the
con_id was found in the _DSD or the GPIOs added by
acpi_dev_add_driver_gpios, but I don't know if there are drivers relyin=
g
on this behavior.

Luckily acpi_get_gpiod_by_index returns -ENODATA if the name can't be
found and -ENOENT if the GPIO is absent, so we can distinguish the two
cases. -EPROBE_DEFER also should not make acpi_find_gpio try to use
another GPIO from the _CRS.

There is also the possibility that the GPIO index exceeds the size of
the package found in _DSD or added with acpi_dev_add_driver_gpios.
The former will return -EPROTO, the latter will forward the error
from acpi_dev_get_property_reference (usually -ENODATA). of_find_gpio
returns -ENOENT in this case.

So, what of this should be fixed?

Best regards,

  Daniel
