It's too late.  Firmware is already shipping with the current layout. 
Unfortunately, there's no good peer review process for DSDs that don't 
have a DT equivalent.

Keep in mind that all this ACPI junk is localized to pinctrl-qdf2xxx. 
pinctrl-msm does not define any new data structures, it just reuses the 
existing one.  You can still define your DT properties any way you want 
in your client drivers.  pinctrl-qdf2xxx is specific to the Centriq chips.

Ok, let me review this.  I don't think there's any gain in moving the 
ACPI processing to pinctrl-msm, however.
