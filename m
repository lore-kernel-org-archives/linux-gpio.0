After more investigation, I do not think it is a good solution to create one
state containing sleep related configs and select it at early point.

First these sleep related configs are pins' attributes, they should be set
depanding on users situation, which means the state containing sleep related
configs should be selected by users. We can not create one "sleep-xxx" state
containing all pins' sleep related configs, and select it when initializing
pinctrl driver.

Second if we create one "sleep-xxx" state containing sleep related configs,
which means we should set one pin's configuration in 2 places.

If we introduce "sleep-input-enable" config, we can set the pin's config
as below:
vio_sd0_ms_3: regctrl3 {
	pins = "SC9860_RFCTL30", "SC9860_RFCTL31", "SC9860_RFCTL32";
	function = "func1";
	sprd,sleep-mode = <0x3>;
	sleep-input-enable;
};

But If we create one extra "sleep-xxx" state for sleep-related configs,
it will be like:
grp1: regctrl3 {
	pins = "SC9860_RFCTL30", "SC9860_RFCTL31";
	function = "func1";
	sprd,sleep-mode = <0x3>;
};

sleep-input: input_grp {
	pins = "SC9860_RFCTL30", "SC9860_RFCTL31", "SC9860_RFCTL32";
	input-enable;
};

pinctrl-names = "sleep-input";
pinctrl-0 = <&sleep-input>;

"sleep-input" state will be selected when initializing pinctrl driver, "grp1"
will be selected by user to set other pin configuration.

Then we need config "SC9860_RFCTL30" pin in 2 different places, which is
more inconvenient for users.

Accoring to above explanation, I think we should introduce these standard
sleep related configs for users, but if you still have strong objection for
it, I think I should introduce some SoC-specific attributes (something like
"sprd,sleep-input") for our driver. LinusW and Rob, do you have any good
suggestion? Thanks.
