Ok. That's testable with acpi_match_device_ids() though. I can
add that into pinctrl-msm.c so we don't have to pass info about
available gpios from ACPI specific driver into the pinctrl-msm
core driver. That's why I'm trying to avoid doing it in the ACPI
specific driver. Do it close to where the gpiochip is created
instead.

Maybe future HIDs could follow the DT design and then we can look
for the same device property name in both firmwares. Parsing
ranges is simpler.

I don't see any place blocking GPIOs turning into IRQs once we
setup the irqdomain with interrupts. Maybe I missed something,
but I think you can request an IRQ once the domain has the hwirqs
associated with it. I will test it out.
