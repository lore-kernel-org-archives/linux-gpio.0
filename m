Thanks for the clarification and examples.

I think solution 1 is fine.

I just want to be sure that flexibilty remains in DT, so it's the DT
files that determine exactly which groups (or pins) will be used.
e.g. it has to stay the case that DT can define a UART without CTS/RTS
signals.

I'm pretty sure that remains the case, since the "groups" property in DT
is selecting from the *available* groups defined in the driver, IIUC.
