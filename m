We need just a confirmation.

Then again, Currently the qcom-ipq4019.dtsi is using 32768 Hz.

|		sleep_clk: sleep_clk {
|			compatible = "fixed-clock";
|			clock-frequency = <32768>;
|			#clock-cells = <0>;
|		};

<https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/arm/boot/dts/qcom-ipq4019.dtsi#L144>

Which makes sense, because all previous Qualcomm Atheros MIPS and the
future IPQ8072 SoCs have been either using or deriving a 32768 Hz clock.

For example: The AR9344 derives the clock from the 25MHz/40MHz external
oscillator. This is explained in "8.16.9 Derived RTC Clock (DERIVED_RTC_CLK)".
Which mentions that the "32KHz" clock interval is 30.5 usec / 30.48 usec
depending whenever the external reference crystal has 40MHz or 25MHz.
(1/30.5usec = 32.7868852 kilohertz!). The QCA9558 datasheet says the same
in "10.19.11 Derived RTC Clock". 

For IPQ8072: I point to the post by Sven Eckelmann on the OpenWrt ML:
<http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/openwrt-devel/2019-May/017131.html>
"I was only able to verify for IPQ8072 that it had a 32.768 KHz
sleep clock." 

So this is pretty much "why there is an issue", it's confusing.
Is possible can you please look if there are (fixed) divisors values
listed in the documentation or the registers and bits that the values
are stored in? Because then we could just calculate it.

Christian
