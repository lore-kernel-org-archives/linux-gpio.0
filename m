If it is possible to create one device per bank I usually prefer that
approach, as it also (often) makes it possible to use the
generic GPIO library, i.e. the hardware abstraction start to
share more with other GPIO controllers.

I don't like 3 cells, stuff is complicated enough as it is already.

Better in that case to concatenate the offsets and instead of
having an extra cell 0, 1 and offsets 0-31, 0-31
have two cells and offsets 0-63.

My reasoning is that since it is represented by a single device
we are indexing into that one device from 0-n.
