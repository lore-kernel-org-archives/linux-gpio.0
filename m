OK what I need to know is the following:

If this was not a gpio chip, just some random hierarchical irqchip
or mux from drivers/irqchip, where would you make the translation?

The answer to that question applies equally to any GPIO controller
that also provides an irqchip. .to_irq() is not the place to do the
translation.

I looked around and for example irq-s3c24xx.c seems to do this
in the irqdomain xlate() callback, which should only be called
when the interrupt is resolved for a consumer.

If that is the code that you partitioned over to drivers/irqchip,
then maybe this is a sign that this code should not be there
at all, but instead inside this gpiochip driver, or atleast accessible
by it so that your gpiochip driver has direct access to the
irqdomain it is using.

They are probably all bad or legacy. None of this works with a
irqchip from DT like this:

foo: gpio@0 {
    #gpio-cells = <2>;
    gpio-controller;
    interrupt-cells = <2>;
    interrupt-controller;
}

bar: bar@1 {
    interrupt-parent = <&foo>;
    interrupt = <4>;
};

Here notice that bar is NOT doing gpios = <&foo 4>;
which is what you would do to get a GPIO and then call
.to_irq() on it. It just uses it as an interrupt controller.

This MUST work, or you cannot put interrupt-controller;
as a keyword on the gpiochip.

Yep.

I don't know either. It's just supposed to be a quick helper
to find the corresponding interrupt for a GPIO, it is not supposed
to have semantic side-effects.

It's a mess allright. I need everyone's help to fix the mess.

Sure patches accepted.

None of them should be allowed to create mappings because of the
explanation above: gpiochips and irqchips need to be
orthogonal.

It doesn't seem to help with anything.

Instead go back to what I described above: if it was just
two irqchips: forget the fact that one of them is a GPIO chip
for a while, just two irqchips.

How does one irqchip map to another one?

That is what needs to happen, solely using the irqchip
infrastructure, NOT using .to_irq().

I think I understand... famous last words.

That seems all right, the problem is relying on gpio_to_irq()
being called for the interrupts to work.
