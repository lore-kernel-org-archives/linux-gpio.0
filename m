A series of patches that add support for GPIO maps that have holes in
them.  That is, even though a client driver has N consecutive GPIOs,
some are just unavailable for whatever reason, and the hardware should
not be accessed for those GPIOs.

Patch 1 reverts an old patch that triggers a get_direction of every
pin upon init, without attempting to request the pins first.  The
direction is already being queried when the pin is requested.

Patch 2 adds support to pinctrl-msm for "unavailable" GPIOs.

Patch 3 extends that support to pinctrl-qdf2xxx.  A recent ACPI change
on QDF2400 platforms blocks access to most pins, so the driver can only
register a subset.

This version drops the availability check in gpiolib, because it's no
necessary.  Instead, just having pinctrl-msm return -EACCES is enough
to block all unavailable GPIOs.  Patch 1 removes the only instance where
an unrequested GPIO is being accessed.

v10:
  Use driver_stuct to obtain ACPI match table entry

Timur Tabi (3):
  [v2] Revert "gpio: set up initial state from .get_direction()"
  [v8] pinctrl: qcom: disable GPIO groups with no pins
  [v6] pinctrl: qcom: qdf2xxx: add support for new ACPI HID QCOM8002
