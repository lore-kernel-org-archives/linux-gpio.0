Yes, this is desired.  The point is that there is no situation in which
we do not want to register all the regulators physically present on the
device.

It would take a lot less effort to implement the requested changes
rather than go on and on about this.  There is no meaningful complexity
here, we're talking about removing code and moving some data tables from
DT (where they are an ABI) to code (where they are not an ABI).

It's hardly a rewrite.

It should already be apparent that this is not a desired configuration,
old drivers are never a good reason not to do the right thing on new
code.
