These chips only support edge triggered interrupts, so I doesn't seem
to me that it does. However, trying to answer that question lead me to
read IRQ related code of the driver, some of which didn't make as much
sense as I'd like it to. It may be due to my ignorance of how some of
the irqchip internals work, but I'll mention it anyway just in case.

It seem strange to me that the driver uses "handle_edge_irq", given
how none of the individual interrupts seem to require any ACKing,
since it is all handled in sx150x_irq_thread_fn(), line 533. More so,
I had trouble finding who/where sets .irq_ack() callback, which AFAIU
is mandatory for handle_edge_irq().

Unfortunately sx150x HW setup that I have doesn't permit to do any
testing of IRQ functionality (the chip is mostly used as GPO), so I
wasn't able to experiment with any of the code in question and shed
any light on my confusion. Apologies if it is just a false alarm.

Thanks,
