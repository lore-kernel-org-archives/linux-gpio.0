Are there more users of this on DT based systems? A quick grep shows a
couple more potential failures, like the qcom based SPMI gpio controllers
and a mediatek one.

It's almost like we should print a huge WARN_ON() if gpio_chip::of_node
is non-NULL and gpochip_add_pin_range() is called. But that probably
would be noisy and can't be fixed on older DT blobs. It may also be good
to bail out of that function if the node pointer exists and the property
is there in the node so that we don't have to go update each driver for
the backwards compat mode like was done in this patch. Plus the function
should get some sort of comment that calling it is not useful on DT
based platforms so this is all documented.

In general, I'm just asking for this to be made much more obvious that
it's wrong to do and more clearly documented.

I get quite a bit of email as you can tell.

The gpio-reserved-ranges only affects some SoCs. It should be added to
the bindings on whatever chips are affected by those firmware quirks as
optional properties. It would be great if you could add it to the ones
that may need it. My guess is that it only matters for the pin
controllers that spread out each pin into a big range of I/O memory
because otherwise pins aren't locked away from non-secure systems.

That's good.

Great!

Sure. Do you have the list of pinctrl devices that may need the
gpio-reserved-ranges property?
