My concern over this is similar to Mark/Als this looks like a quick hack
to "solve" an issue that has been worked on in Linux for at least 10
years now. And thats how to describe a non descoverable card that is
plugged into random busses on a SoC.

The issue I see with a quick hack of DT pinctrl into _DSD is that this
does not take into account the power model of ACPI. As far as I can see
the core code has no manner to tell a pin/function allocated through
_DSD actually has effects on the power of other devices. So the core
could end up powering down devices when it should not. This is very
relevent to your intended use of IoT devices where power control is key.

Why has there been no attempt in ASWG to make these sort of features a
1st class citizen of ACPI so they can interact correctly with the other
features?

Thanks

Graeme
