I think this is easily solved with a connector having 2 halves and
that we need to search parents for *-map properties. Inheriting from
parents is a common pattern in DT though perhaps not walking the
parents of a phandle. So we'd have something like this:

base-connector-1 {
  gpio-map = ...
  connector {
    child {
      some-gpios = <&connector 1>;
    };
  };
};

base-connector-2 {
  gpio-map = ...
  connector {
    child {
      some-gpios = <&connector 1>;
    };
  };
};

Now, how we resolve that /connector from an overlay targets
/base-connector-1 and /base-connector-2 is an orthogonal issue and one
that's going to be connector specific (at least for probe-able
connectors).
