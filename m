I think I see what you mean.
Even though "gpio-hog =3D <&phandle>" guarantee that only those sub-nod=
e
are going to be parsed, if a particular gpio-controller has sub-node fo=
r
some other reason then the "hog" related sub-node might be in the way.

Do you know of such an example currently in mainline I can take a look =
at?

I guess if we add the export feature then that could be possible.
But if I am not mistaken the hog concept was to allow gpio setting
for gpio not belonging to any particular drivers.
If you have gpio which needs to be released then would they fall in
the "own" by a driver category and which case use the exixting method?=20

I see, I had not consider that.

A generic board level gpio driver would be a different option I guess.
