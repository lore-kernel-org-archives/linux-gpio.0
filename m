Drivers will/could work fine without those options enabled and
filesystems mounted. Nothing in this patch series affects that, nor
would not applying the patch series.

However, you only need this patch series if there's some kind of
problematic resource conflict and you want to debug it. If your system
has a problem and you want to debug it, it seems entirely reasonable to
make use of (require making use of) the debugging tools that are already
part of the kernel.
