Sure. Until now ODR is cleared as reset default while INTPOL explicitly gets cleared. So the INT output pin on the MCP23S17 is an active-low output pin which will trigger an active-low interrupt. While this is useually great, as most interrupt pins are active low, our board design requires an active-high output. This is done that the voltage level shift required for the interrupt pin can be done by a simple transistor.
So, setting IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH is simply wrong and this still won't work either as no interrupt will ever arive at the controller. What I need to do, is to change the interrupt polarity (to active high) at MCP23S17 while retaining the interrupt polarity on the controller as active-low.
So I configure the chip to set the interrupt line as high upon IRQ, thus IRQF_TRIGGER_HIGH has to be passed to request_*irq.
You might wonder why I then also changed IRQF_TRIGGER_LOW to IRQF_TRIGGER_HIGH for my board the interrupt line is actually active low. This is due the fact that GIC only supports active high-interrupts (any other flag results in request fail) but the microcontroller has a feature to inverse these interrupt triggers.
I don't know if there is a feature to inverse interrupt polarity individually due to board designs.
I hope this makes things a bit more clear.

Best regards,
Alexander
