Is this desired? If they are not in the DT could this be used to signal
we don't want to register this regulator?

Same questions as above. ^^^

Adding any extra code and complexity to use a helper that does something
that already works with less doesn't make much sense to me, but if that's
the API you want I'll use it.

I'm sorry if I sounded overly argumentative about this, I'm just trying to make
points in favor of me not having to re-write my driver.

The new framework helpers do not help my driver as it does things differently.
You signed off on this different way of doing things just last year with the
TPS65218.

If you no longer want it done this way then I'll go and change my driver.

Nothing meant to be remarkable, I was pointing out uses.

OK
