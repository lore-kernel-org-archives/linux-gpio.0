Yeah we should probably respect a few errors and let some
pass. Please make a patch!

Well I guess if you look in the debugfs files it looks crazy does
it not? That is how I verify that the pins get bound right.
Especially in the file pinmux-pins

Bah if the device tree is wrong it is wrong, we certainly do not
expect erroneous device trees that just "happen to work" to
keep working.

I don't understand.

Where is this device tree, so I can look at it?

Hm, ask the Atmel DT maintainers what to do about this...
Nicolas: how real is this ABI issue?

We have patches bigger issues than this one before though.

I think so. The device trees should be correct, errors should be
handled.
