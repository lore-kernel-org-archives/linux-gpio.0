Even if we introduce a new interface (and I don't see traction towards
this yet), sysfs is just too convenient for 90% of the cases to leave
it borderline-unusable as it is currently. The obligation to use
global numbers that potentially change every boot is getting us
complaints every week or so - this series sounds like a good way to
reduce our inbox volume, and if only for that, I encourage it being
pursued. :)

It will also not get in the way of a new user-space interface, so why
refrain from these extra ~90 lines of code?

Alex.
