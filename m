gpio_request_enable() allows to switch to the GPIO pin function.

To clarify the situation, from my point of view there are two issues:

- Several pin controllers didn't enabled the strict mode when they were
  introduced. Nowadays, enabling it will break several DTs. Maybe a DT
  property to enable/disable strict mode could do the trick: we remove
  pinctrl nodes (so pinmux + pinconf) for pins which will be requested
  by gpiod_request() and we set the strict property to true.

- But... The GPIO pin configuration is missing. Some configuration features
  have been added, we can continue to add new ones but I am not sure
  it's the best solution. At the moment, we rely on a single cell to
  manage the configuration. It may not be enough and each time a new pin
  configuration will appear, it will have to be added both to the gpiolib
  and pinconf.

I agree but it seems we have started to follow this path.

Sorry, what do you see behind "hand over the reference"?

I have the feeling that 1 and 2 are achievable with pinctrl states. 3 may be
also acheviable excepting if the pin is part of a pinctrl state.

I share another case which is the one motivating me to do these patches.

I am writing a driver for a new device which uses several lines. The lines used
depends on the firmware loaded so there is no reason to reserve all the
lines and so the pins corresponding to these lines.

The pins will be requested as GPIOs because the pin controller in this specific
case is bypassed. I mean, if the device uses a line, it will take the ownership
even if it is muxed to a function. I want to prevent this.

Before using the line, I'll request the pin as a GPIO. If an error occurs (this
is why I need to enable the strict mode), it means the pin is already muxed and
we are going to break the device which uses it.
