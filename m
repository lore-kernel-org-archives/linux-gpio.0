This is what syscon is for. Regmap simply abstracts any register IO.
For instance: there's no locking in this driver. Are we sure it's not
needed? Regmap provides internal locking for you in the form of a
mutex or spinlock.

Also: it looks like the interrupts here are quite simple with a single
bit per interrupt in the status register and the same layout in the
mask register - it could probably profit from using the
regmap_irq_chip and not bother with reimplementing irq_chip callbacks.

Code shrinkage IMO.

Note that I'm not blocking this from being merged - I just think that
using modern frameworks is always a good idea.
