Yeah, sorry for that. I will use your helpers in the future for sure
in the suitable parts of the code inside and outside of GPIO, just not
in a highest priority to me.

As I mentioned earlier I'm pretty sure I found as well opportunity to
use this new API
outside of GPIO realm. I just want to be sure (means of testing on real HW).
