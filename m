Fair enough :)

I'll try to keep this short: I don't like "output-enable", and at the
same time I don't think "output-high" and "output-low" fit well for
this purpose, as they electrically means something different from what
our (and IMX) use case is: enabling/disabling input/output
buffers internal to pin controller/gpio block HW and not driving a value
there.

This seems clear to me from the "GPIO mode pitfalls" section of
pinctrl.txt documentation examples and from the fact that generic bindings
did not expose an "output" flag because if you drive an output line, you
reasonably either drive it high or low.

Unfortunately I cannot convince myself that the same reasons apply
to the input use case.  Enabling input on a pin implies the pinctrl/gpio driver
has to enable any input buffer required to use that pin as a properly
working input line, and enabling an input buffer implies being able to sense
the line value from there, so I don't see that much use for "input-buffer-enable"
alone.

So, even if bindings could look a bit weird as there won't be a direct
matching between properties names used to enable input/output buffers,
my vote is to add "output-buffer-enable" only, and keep using the
already there "input-enable" properties for the input use case.

Thanks
