Send them too.

It looks drastic, but it change name of function and adds one parameter to it.
And of course dt probe.

Didn't know that dt is using someone else.

I'm not happy too.

It would be nice, but yesterday was late.
Even nicer would be /dev/in13, /dev/out20 etc.

As I know, no one is good for me. May be I could use gpio-led for outputs,
but they would be under sysfs/leds and it isn't clear. And what for inputs?

It is hardware, my board has IN13, IN14 ... OUT19, GSM_ON etc. Why didn't
access them by right HW name.

Thanks
