There are many aspects to this and I have no strong opinion,
it doesn't really disturb me either way as both are familiar
ways of writing drivers be it modular or not.

I think it's more disturbing that bool drivers have .remove()
functions, and as pointed out elsewhere this is because the
module can still be bound/unbound from sysfs even if compiled
into the kernel and then that code path will actually be executed.

And as I remarked again, elsewhere, that can be overcome
by adding the .suppress_bind_attrs = true to struct device_driver
inside the platform driver.

So if going through all the hazzle to remove anything compiled-out
for non-modules, also take the step above removing .remove()
calls and setting .suppress_bind_attrs.

I will maybe do so sometime myself for any bool drivers...

Yours,
