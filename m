That's your a) which I called output-low-init

That's your b) which I called output-init-low.

... which I called input-init.

This is just a permutation of words, and so doesn't fix the problem that
a) and b) use similar words. For you it's "init" before the stuff
that can be changed. For me it's "init" is after the stuff that can be
changed. 
I slightly prefer my naming here because we already have "output-low"
and "output-high" and my names also use direction-before-value.

But I interpret your reply as interest and general confirmation that the
idea is fine.

That works already today.

Best regards
