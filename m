For sure it was not the kind of answer I was looking for :) I understand
your point of view.

I won't discuss about the design of the pinctrl. I don't have enough
knowledge about other controllers and I have never worked on a midlayer.

My concern is the actual pinctrl doesn't fit my needs and add some strong
constraints. I don't have the time (and probably not the skill) to
re-design pinctrl without introducing breakage for existing users. My
goal is to try to find some ways to make it more flexible.

Linus, what do you think about all this? Are the changes proposed
acceptable?

Ludovic
