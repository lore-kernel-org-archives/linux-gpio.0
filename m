I think you're spot in.

This kind of problem has cropped up in these subsystems since day
one and we probably just have different lame attempts to paper
over it all over.

I suspect that what we need to do is more akin to the DRM model
which I recently learned about (drivers/gpu/drm/vc4/vc4_drv.c is a very
clean and good example) using the core kernel component
infrastructure:

1. Drivers probe() independently, doing intiialization of state
  container struct and retreiveing resources like I/O memory,
  regulators, IRQ, DMA... but no registering interfaces to
  the subsystems yet.

2. The probe of the main component (master) matches the
  subcomponents on the platform bus. In this case, whatever
  needs to come first is the master. I guess pin control.
  return component_master_add_with_match(dev, &vc4_drm_ops, match);

3. Subcomponents:
   return component_add(&pdev->dev, &vc4_dsi_ops);

4. Later on we take control over the binding order.
   the .bind callback of the main component issues
   component_bind_all(dev, drm) and there the subdevices
   are bound.

The process is perfectly reversible. The idea here is to break the
neck of the problem by doing enough set-up in probe() so that
bind() can commence with all its resources. My Nomadik driver
already makes a half-assed attempt at this (not using the component
framework) but I could refactor it to provide an example if
there is interest.
