I'm very happy with this series and no matter if it would cause some
stir while merging, the kernel looks so much better for millions of
phones after this patch that it is worth pursuing aggressively.
It also shows the way for other platforms. (And taught me a great
deal about hierarchical interrupts as well.)

It'd be nice to have Stephen's ACK on the SPMI parts so I can merge
all the code through the pin control subsystem.

Regarding the device trees, I think we usually merge device tree
changes in parallel (orthogonally) and as long as the end result
after merging both driver code and device tree changes is correct
we do not bother *too* much about any intermittent states.

That said I can of course merge the DTS changes in the pin control
tree if I get some ACK from the Qualcomm maintainers.

Else I will just apply patches 1-7 to the pin control tree ASAP and
the DTS changes need to go through qcom (Andy's tree) and
ARM SoC.

Thoughts?

Yours,
Linus Walleij
