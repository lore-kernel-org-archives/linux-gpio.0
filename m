Yeah, the preserve polarity was another thing I debated given the
current example with the Arizona driver. Not preserving is the default
for the Aspeed hardware, so that ended up influencing my choice. Not
that implementation details should necessarily influence interface
design, but it was at least more than a coin toss.

I don't have anything specific against preserving by default, just my
gut instinct and the hardware went the other way. As long as we expose
the option to opt out, which the additions for the Arizona already do.

Cheers,

Andrew
