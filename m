I can move it within drivers/gpio since my only use at moment is for
these gpio drivers I maintain. However, moving it to the gpio subsystem
does make it less likely to be seen by authors in other subsystems who
may have use for it -- so there is the chance that this becomes isolated
and untilized only amonst the gpio drivers. That may not be such a bad
thing in the end; I suspect it will be easy to spot if other subsystems
start implementing their own for_each_set_clump (if other subsystems
would even have such a need for it).

Linus, if I move the for_each_set_clump macro and related functions to
drivers/gpio, should I move the code into the gpiolib.h and gpiolib.c
files? Or would it be best to implement this as a separate standalone
module, and make a Kconfig dependency for those gpio drivers which
require it? A standalone module feels somewhat overkill for such little
code in my opinion.
