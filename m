I guess the expectation should be that it's a Joe Average user in the
Allwinner case at least. It's far from the exception that someone that
never got any kernel (or electronics) experience before jumps in,
creates a DT for the shiny new board they just received and then
submits it.

I guess it's more the case in the Allwinner case than for any other
SoCs I've worked on at least, probably because of its widespread use
in the low-end consumer market and their reputation amongst hackers,
but still, this is basically our default.

I guess the difference would be that's it's active in your example,
while the pinmux will be set even if a user doesn't do anything. And I
can testify that you can very well permanently fry a board passively
using pinctrl :)

And I'll just add here that if the data size is of concern, as it can
be in a bootloader, you can very well have partial tables. There's
plenty of devices that will be of no use in a bootloader.
