I looked at it for half an hour and could not figure out if it was
wrong or right really, eventually maybe got it wrong, maybe right.

What is happening is that the code is getting so convoluted that I cannot
follow the program flow, which is a clear sign that refactoring is needed.

Either restructure, add comments or break our helper functions.
