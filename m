Sorry for the long delay with testing, but here come the results.
I've rebased everything to 4.1-rc1

1. WFI + DeepIdle =3D> freeze after approx:
   * 1 hours and 30 minutes, first test
   * 3 hours and 40 minutes, second test
2. WFI only (DeepIdle disabled via sysfs) =3D> Still alive after 13 hou=
rs=20
and counting

The proper patchset will follow as soon as I figure out what change=20
broke
dns320l-daemon (The utility that speaks to weltrend mcu on ttyS1)
It was working on 3.18.6, on 3.19 and up - it writes data to the port=20
(and mcu acks it),
but can't read any responses.

Same thing happens to the python (pyserial inside) implementation of th=
e=20
fan-daemon:
