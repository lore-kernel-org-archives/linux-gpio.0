We've explicitly forbidden such a use case. There is a (not exactly fool
proof) check in irq_domain_push_irq(), but it is pretty easy to bypass
it. "Don't do it" is the conclusion we reached with David Daney.

If you don't want these interrupts to be requested, you might as well
flag them as IRQ_NOREQUEST, and unflag them when the hierarchy is ready.

Would that work for you?

Thanks,
