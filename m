I was hoping to delete Calxeda rather than fix. I'm pretty sure none
of the distros are using the systems anymore and they were the main
users for a while. Otherwise, I would have converted all the bindings
it uses.

Clocks not from DT was supposed to be a transitional thing...

There shouldn't be.
