We don't know, it's a relableled chip with
TI-NSPIRE / L9A0702 / TI-NS2006A-0 / LSI LOGIC / ZEVIO / U 0714 /  
WYJ14052-1
on it. But this driver should match the other drivers (lsi,zevio-intc,  
lsi,zevio-timer).

I added it just for someone who maybe needs it. It's only two lines and  
maybe
it'll be helpful for someone. We don't know whether some similiar or this  
controller
exist in different configurations (pin count, section sice, register  
layout).
Also I hate hardcoded values which require a recompile to change..

I forgot to remove this line after testing the interrupts, the tests went  
horribly (hard lockups)...

V4 should be underway soon.

Bye,
Fabian
