Sorry I may miss things like that... usually it is better if patches
that depend on each other for merging are in the same series.

I don't understand. Tell me what I need to do or we can just wait
a kernel cycle before merging this I guess.

Either I need an immutable branch or I merge the clock patches
I guess. Neither is very good but I'm open to compromises.

I see. Well if nothing else works, we just defer.

Indeed, sorry, the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is
doing sometimes.

OK
