If i understand it correctly, pinctrl_pin_desc is essential part of
pinmux framework. Theoretically i should define just statical array of
this struct, but by this number of pins and functions it hard to keep it
readable and error free. So i decided to create asm9260_mux_table which
contains every thing i need. The side effect is higher memory usage
since i need to create pinctrl_pin_desc on fly.

May be i miss some thing?

please read debugfs.
