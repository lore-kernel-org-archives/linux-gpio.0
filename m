I considered spi and i2c the good examples here :-|

in my case (with a pre 4.8 kernel) it's to control GPIO48 with
/sys/class/gpio/gpio48. But also when using the gpio chardev device
(that will hit 4.8-rc1 AFAIK) there is one device file per gpio chip.

Now consider a user who wants to control/debug direction and value of
GPIO48 (or GPIO2.16 for the chardev case). The strait forward approach
is to use /sys/class/gpio/gpio48 (or /dev/dontknowthename2 with offset
16). I doubt there is a platform where it didn't work like this up to
now and I'd consider it a userspace breakage to force the user to know
that the 2nd gpio bank is located at address 0x53fd0000 and so to looku=
p
the gpio bank below /sys/bus/platform/devices/53fd0000.gpio/.

On an i.MX25 device I currently see:

root@hostname:/sys/bus/gpio/devices ls -l
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             0 Jul  5 20:52 gpiochip0 -> .=
=2E/../../devices/platform/soc/53f00000.aips/53f9c000.gpio/gpiochip0
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             0 Jul  5 20:52 gpiochip1 -> .=
=2E/../../devices/platform/soc/53f00000.aips/53fa4000.gpio/gpiochip1
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             0 Jul  5 20:52 gpiochip2 -> .=
=2E/../../devices/platform/soc/53f00000.aips/53fcc000.gpio/gpiochip2
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root             0 Jul  5 20:52 gpiochip3 -> .=
=2E/../../devices/platform/soc/53f00000.aips/53fd0000.gpio/gpiochip3

That is we have:

	Hardware name | software gpiochip
	    GPIO4     |      gpiochip0
	    GPIO3     |      gpiochip1
	    GPIO1     |      gpiochip2
	    GPIO2     |	     gpiochip3

I bet that's the probe order because when sorted by address (and so
by order in the device tree) we have exactly this ordering. (Compare
with $(grep gpio@ arch/arm/boot/dts/imx25.dtsi).)

=46or a new interface this is OK, still I predict users will complain i=
f
the numbers used don't match naturally the hardware names. And IMHO the=
y
are right.

Best regards
Uwe
