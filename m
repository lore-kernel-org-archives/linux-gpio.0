Good point about the OpRegion driver usually being built-in, in my experience
it MUST always be built-in, so the Kconfig option should be a bool. Note this
is useless unless the mfd driver is also a bool (I would advice to go that
route) and the mfd driver's Kconfig should select the right i2c bus driver
to make sure that is built-in too, see for example:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/lee/mfd.git/commit/?h=for-mfd-next&id=2f91ded5f8f4fdd67d8daae514b0d434c98ab1e0
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/lee/mfd.git/commit/?h=for-mfd-next&id=c5065d8625ebdc164199b99d838ac0636faa7f0b
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/lee/mfd.git/commit/?h=for-mfd-next&id=5f125f1f570568a29edf783fba1ebb606d5c6b24

Which are all recent commits from me dealing with making the mfd driver
built-in / selecting the i2c bus driver.
