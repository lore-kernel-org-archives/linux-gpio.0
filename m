If Marc Z is happy I think I will apply all patches on an immutable branch in
the pin control tree, so that ARM SoC and GPIO can pull it in later if need
be. (E.g. if they get conflicts.)

I was thinking to also include the DTS changes as it all is so neatly
coupled, then offer the branch to ARM SoC.

Anyone against?
