Okay.

Not in the sense that the dimensions are encoded into the property,
but the binding doc can define that. You know one dimension is 2, so
you could figure out the other. But it's fine as is.

Really, this binding should be 1 node per chip instead, but I don't
know how you would describe that. You'd need a parent node with reg
for the chipselect, and then child nodes for each chip.

No, the supply properties should correspond to the power pins/rails.
So it would be whichever property is present that tells you if 5V or
24V is hooked up.

But I'm not that concerned with a single property like this if you
feel strongly about it and want to avoid the complexity of the
regulator binding.
