As it is today we already have support for open drain/collector in the
GPIO subsystem, as open drain pins should not be actively driven
to 1 and open source pins not actively driven to 0, instead set as
input for each of these use cases.
(See drivers/gpio/gpiolib.c, grep for OPEN_DRAIN)

So this is up to the driver to implement today, but last week
Tony Lindgren and Grygorii Strashko approached me to add flags
for this into the GPIO subsystem as well.

We already have a few GPIO drivers cross-calling
pinctrl_request_gpio()
pinctrl_free_gpio()
pinctrl_gpio_direction_input()
pinctrl_gpio_direction_output()

So we can very well add a
pinctrl_gpio_set_config() to set up pulls, open drain/source,
drive strength etc if it makes sense.

Yes and Tony/Grygorii want to do that from the GPIO consumer
side.

We will hash it out as we go along, but I see no immediate
blocker for this.
