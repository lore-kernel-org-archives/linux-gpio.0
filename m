This has nothing to do with compatible strings. Your current approach of
defining a static list of interrupts and then dynamically allocating
things that point directly to it feels wrong. just define a second
instance of this IP to be convinced of it.

So either you support something that is fully dynamic (supporting
multiple instances at every level), or you only support *one*, and
everything becomes mostly static.

It infinitely better to describe the signal path rather than the call
stack (which is actually GIC->GPIO_IRQ->GIC->handler).

Well, let's face it: It is global (see my earlier rant). And if you
device to support multiple instances, you can attach the parent array at
the irq domain level, and still perform that same index calculation.
