Hmm, so your suggesting to have mfd instantiate 2 platform devices
for this, a gpio and a pinctrl device, each with their own
driver. Yes that would work, but I'm a bit worried about the 2
racing or some such since they both will end up touching
bit 0-2 of register 0x90 / 0x92, more-over since they are both
touching the exact same bits I've the feeling that this really
should be one driver.

I guess that in a proper written dts we either use pinctrl to enable
a special function, or gpio, but still.

I was assuming we would use one mfd-child(-platform)-device for this,
not two. I guess that with 2 devices you're right and there should
not be any problem, still as said it feels wrong-ish to have 2 drivers
poking bits 0-2 of reg 0x90 / reg 0x92.
