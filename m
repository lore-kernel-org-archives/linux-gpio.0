Actually you don't have to modify the kernel you can setup the CPU idle level
you want at runtime:

echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpuidle/state1/disable

will disable the state1. By doing this on Armada 370 then you
will only use the WFI state.

Do you still have this issue on v4.0-rc7?

Thanks,

Gregory
