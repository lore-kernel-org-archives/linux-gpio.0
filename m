handled the same... as what?

Do you mean as we have in mainline today?  or as is proposed in $SUBJECT patch?

Can somone do a quick patch for PWM_F for example, also showing how this
will look in the DT if someone wants to switch between the PWM_F on GPIOX
or GPIOCLK?

We shouldalso verify that the driver is detecting/removing conflicts
properly when something else is already using that pin (e.g. SDIO_IRQ
shares pin GPIOX_7 with PWM_F)
