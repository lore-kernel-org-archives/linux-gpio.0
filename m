So, I see this way how it can be enabled:
1. IP_ENI + IP_ENO internally defines BiDi when PMC and PIPC bits are set
2. BiDi bit is set and BUFOE is set

Now the question is what the real use case for 2?

If we find one we need to rename and fix a description of the pin
control configuration property.

like:
@PIN_CONFIG_OUTPUT_INPUT_ENABLE: this will configure the pin as an output.
...
Note: As long as it's enabled the pin's input enabled as well and vice versa.

Okay, these are related to pin muxing explicitly.
So, you have 10 functions overall?
What prevents you describe them accordingly and hide this
implementation detail in the driver?

Yes, that figure helped me a lot to understand.
