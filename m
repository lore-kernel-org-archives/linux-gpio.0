I had a closer looked to the binding when syscon is used with several
subnodes. And actually the reg usage is very uncommon, I only find it in
drivers/regulator/pbias-regulator.c but for legacy.

I am not sure that we have any benefit with this reg property: we won't
use the length of the register and we need to add a range property in
the parent node.

An other way to pass this information is to have a different compatible
string which will match the different offset available. In this case the
reg property won't be used in a syscon node. However, while it makes
sens for the difference between AP806 and CP110, it would be strange to
have a different compatible string for gpio bank 1 and gpio bank 2.

So, in the end I would prefer to use the offset. From my point of view
it is better to not use the reg property for two different purposes:
mmio address vs offset in a syscon.

But if you think that from the point of view of the device tree
compliance we have to use the reg property, of course I will change it.

Thanks,

Gregory
