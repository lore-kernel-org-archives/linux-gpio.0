Isn't every DSDT (etc) unique? So you could detect one by making
a checksum of the binary or something.

And then you'd know that the table with this checksum needs
patching?

As per above? Fix the firmware table, not work around the
fact that it is buggy.

Not at all. The other suggestion leads to having custom per-board
fixes in every driver for which broken ACPI descriptions exists,
which is just as bad, isn't it? Instead of collecting the problem
in one place (patch any broken ACPI table) it is distrubuted across
N drivers, where each and every one has to detect that it is
being malinformed by a broken ACPI table.
