Well, no. EXTI has been merged when I already submitted the RFC for this driver,
but that's not the point I suppose.

Maybe you missed it in our previous discussion with Linus but, no you can't
create mapping in gpio_to_irq. This callback is fast and creating mappings might
sleep because of the irq_domain mutex

I can only speculate regarding the design choice of STM EXTI, but I suppose the
EXTI controller is independent of the pinmux/gpio subsystem HW wise. It's only
weakly linked to the gpios, in the way that you have (or can create) a "map"
between the gpio and the irq line number provided.

That is also the case for the amlogic gpio-irq. I suppose that's why Neil
suggested to look at EXTI. That's also why I commented that this should be first
implemented as an independent controller of the gpio subsys  (so in
drivers/irqchip)

You may find it more complex, which is arguable, but it is a more accurate
representation of the HW.

Which is also possible in the series, where the controller is gpio-irq device
itself. This is what the HW provide, so it should be possible. It would be nice
to have your way working as well, which I think is possible (PSB)

I think you are onto something. As I told you previously, the problem was to
create the mappings in pinctrl w/o allocating the parent. I struggled with that
back in November and I had no time to really get back to it since.

Creating domains in each gpio controller, w/ all the mapping created at startup,
  stacked to the domain provided by the driver/irqchip would solve the problem.

We would just have to call find_mapping in gpio_to_irq, which is fine and
allocate the parent irq in the request_ressource callback.

The fact is that the HW does not directly support IRQ_EDGE_BOTH. Yes, it would
be nice to find a way to support it anyway. There two possibilities for it:
* Change the change the edge type depending on the next expected edge: Marc
already stated that he is firmly against that. It is indeed not very robust
* Allocate and deallocate additional parent irq to get secondary irq in
set_type: This indeed looks hacky, I'd like to get the view of irq maintainers
on this.

Within reasonable limits, having more or less data, code lines does not make a
driver better or worse.
