I have no immediate plans to make this a module, but since the changes
to make it buildable as a module have no overhead (at least I think
they don't!) I'd prefer to leave them in for consistency and to
eliminate any need for these changes in the future.  I'll leave it up
to LinusW though.

Thanks,
Andrew
