I don't know if this is a good idea. I don't want to clutter the
gpiolib ABI for no good reason.

For certain this should only be available for drivers using pin
control as a back-end for their GPIOs.

For that purpose we have (in <linux/pinctrl/consumer.h>:

/* External interface to pin control */
extern int pinctrl_request_gpio(unsigned gpio);
extern void pinctrl_free_gpio(unsigned gpio);
extern int pinctrl_gpio_direction_input(unsigned gpio);
extern int pinctrl_gpio_direction_output(unsigned gpio);

It would be more natural to add a function pinctrl_is_gpio(unsigned gpio)
to call back to the pin controller, then that can be called from
the generic or driver-specific debug print callback.
