Yes, in the case of compatible string "brcm,iproc-gpio-only" is 
detected, the driver only registers 'gpiochip_add_data'. Please check 
patch 2/4 of this series, which takes care of it.

This driver does not register itself as a PINCONF driver if 
"brcm,iproc-gpio-only" compatible string is detected. This is addressed 
in patch 2/4 of this series.

Pin based IOMUX GPIO override is only activated when 
'chip->pinmux_is_supported' is true, and it is only true if the optional 
DT property "gpio-ranges" is defined.

I believe the current issue with this patch series is now only on the 
naming of the new compatible string "brcm,iproc-gpio-only". Please 
correct me if I'm wrong.

Thanks,

Ray
