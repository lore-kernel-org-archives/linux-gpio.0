Could be, I didn't check. Perhaps copy and pasting is to blame. (Copy
and pasting appears to me a sensible way to start writing a new driver).

Did I miss a comment or a remark in the commit explanation that explains
this? Anyhow, if that modular future is not expected to be the near
future, can you perhaps carry these lines in a branch called, say
pinctrl-modular?

Thanks,
