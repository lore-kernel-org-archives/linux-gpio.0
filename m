There is no problem with runtime overhead, only with footprint.

The array of sizeof(gpio_desc) increases to double.

struct looks like so:

struct gpio_desc {
        struct gpio_device      *gdev;
        unsigned long           flags;
        const char              *label;
        const char              *name;
};

Looks like 4x32 bits in most cases, so this means a 4*4*1024 =
16 KiB footprint increase.

We have had to allocate this statically because so many playforms still
use the legacy GPIO API.

Not really, if they have this many GPIOs.

Helping out ridding the kernel of users of the old GPIO global
numberspace ABI is appreciated though.
