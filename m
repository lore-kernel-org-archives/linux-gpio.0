thank you for review, this is the most broken GPIO controller I've ever
seen, so many common generalized concepts present in the kernel are not
applicable, unfortunately.

Here is just a short description of "the best hw design practices" from the
SoC documentation:

* 6 GPIO banks (similar properties of GPIO lines within a bank): P0 (8
lines), P1 (24 lines), P2 (13 lines), GPIO (6 lines), GPO (24 lines, output
only), GPI (22 lines, input only),

 - gpio-output-only property is for GPO,
 - gpio-input-only property is for GPI,

* but 4 mixed register spaces: P0 (holds controls of P0), P1 (controls of
P1), P2 (controls of P2 and GPIO), P3 (controls of GPIO, GPO and GPI),

Here is the first answer to your questions, not each bank has a unique
physical address, GPIO bank controls are in two register spaces and one
register space contains controls of 3 banks.

So there must be another way to address banks, I reused an existing one from
the legacy code, banks are enumerated from 0 to 5.

Also this "bank address" has been already used by the existing GPIO
consumers, I'd be glad to have one device per bank (and that's actually in
my plans for future), but this requires an update of all GPIO clients in DTS
files, I deliberately separate this task from the GPIO controller driver
update task.

* only P2 bank has controls to set output value, but has no register to read
out the set output value,

 -  gpio-no-output-state property is for P2,

* due to the fact that P2 register space has GPIO bank controls, one more
property is introduced:

 - gpio-offset property for GPIO,

* GPIO names in GPI bank are discrete (that caused a problem you've recently
applied a fix for), all other banks has continuous GPIO names,

* GPIO - 6 lines, each is capable to produce an interrupt, interrupt on GPIO
line can be IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH if the driver reads a line state out, but IRQ
chip itself does not support edge-both interrupts, this bank potentially can
be converted to use GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP, but please see the next point,

* GPI - 22 lines, but only 12 can produce an interrupt, so GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP
helper can not be used here, to keep the code smaller (one less exception
for the banks) I've shared the same mechanism of assigning GPIO lines to
IRQs from GPI bank to GPIO bank.

 - gpio-input-mask property of GPIO and GPI banks, mapping between lines and
interrupts

You may see that adding of 5 bank specific properties mentioned above allow
to generalize all 6 banks, any of the banks now can be converted to a
separate GPIO controller device with the same compatible in one step, but
this is postponed at the moment.

The node name in most cases and in the example below is "gpio-controller",
at least in this particular case I find it insufficiently informative, P0
bank is sensibly different from P2, as well as it is different from GPI,
GPIO or GPO. A good mechanism to understand in userspace what particular
bank is involved is wanted here, probably I can add a "label" property? Or
should I replace gpio-controller@xxx device node names with p0@xxx etc.?

Agree.

The necessity comes from the fact that there is an intersection of register
spaces for banks P2 and GPIO, when it concerns GPIO, DIR_CLR/DIR_STATE
registers has a bit offset to control GPIO bank lines.

Ok, will use ngpios. Offset feature won't help, because there is no uniform
offset (except 0) for any of the banks...

I'll add more info, shortly if you once find LPC32xx User's Manual (it is
public), this property contains two values, the first one repeats mapping of
P3_INP_STATE bits to bank specific lines, the second one (subset of the
first) lists input lines, which can produce an interrupt.

Will extend this description. Generally your understanding is correct, a
requested GPIO interrupt is propagated to an IRQ chip interrupt, the handled
IRQ chip interrupt is cascaded to the GPIO interrupt, but some specific
handling of both edges type of interrupt is done on GPIO interrupt
controller side, because IRQ chip interrupt can not support edge-both type
of interrupts.

Ok.

Thanks for review. If you find that conceptually any other scheme of device
tree node properties or bank layout is more applicable in this particular
case, please let me know.
