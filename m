The main issue is that IRQ_TYPE_NONE is a bit loosely defined, and
mostly means "keep whatever was there before", which is a bit like
rolling a dice each time you allocate an interrupt.

I'd suggest you force the type to a "safe" value such as rising edge,
and let the irq_set_type() call do the right thing, assuming you've
plugged the issue in the core SPMI driver.
