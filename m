It's fine, and some people do describe them.  I've just never seen the
point, especially if you have a nice example of their use in the
document.  But if you insist, please ensure you are consistent, so
*all* bools need to be described.  That is not currently the case.

That is also an acceptable means to solve the issue.

As I said, there are many ways to skin a cat.
