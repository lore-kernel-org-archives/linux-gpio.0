Doesn't work for GPIOs AFAIK.

These are claimed, by the sysfs interface.

We had that discussion and I don't think GPIO keys is the right solutio=

for every use-case.

Sure, but the is_visible thing is effectively broken for GPIO. I think =
a
GPIO is in a defined state when exported and the checks all work on tha=
t
state during export. But then this state can be changed through the
sysfs interface. So, if the initial state hides something it becomes
unavailable for all times and, vice versa, if the initial state makes
something visible, it will stay even when it is no longer a valid
property to change.
