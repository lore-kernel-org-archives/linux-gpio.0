Yes, it there are a few. In the reply to the original report from Sven I found:
<https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-arm-msm/msg34726.html>
pinctrl-mt7622, pinctrl-mtk-common.c, pinctrl-abx500.c, pinctrl-msm.c,
pinctrl-as3722.c, pinctrl-at91-pio4.c, pinctrl-axp209.c, pinctrl-coh901.c,
pinctrl-digicolor.c, pinctrl-pistachio.c, pinctrl-sx150x.c

.. And now the new Actions S900 gpio/pinctrl patch as well.

Agreed. Though, adding a warning now is likely a bit much, since the code
has to be compatible with existing definitions. But if Linus agrees I think
it would be fair to call drivers out with something like "the use of this 
function is deprecated for DT" debug level message.

(As for the documentation update to gpiochip_add_pin_range() and 
gpiochip_add_pingroup_range(). yeah I'll give it a go.)

Oh, let me clarify. My plan is to add the binding documentation text for 
the (now) semi-required gpio-ranges property. And while I'm patching the
files in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/qcom-* I can also add
the new gpio-reserved-ranges as an optional property well. This way it is
in place for the future. (This is nothing fancy. As both properties are
part of the gpio.txt already).

As for the dtsi updates, I don't think I can add any sensible
gpio-reserved-ranges to the individual SoC's dts in 
arch/arm(64)/boot/dts/qcom-*dtsi without the HW/SoC or the documentation
which ranges need to be reserved. Because unlike the gpio-ranges values
(which are easy to extract from the drivers in drivers/pinctrl/qcom/)
the gpio-reserved-ranges for each SoCs is not yet documented (or I can't
find it?).
