Oh, OK, I've obviously missed that.

I don't know... I'm somehow not really convinced to that, because
AFAIK there isn't any SPI master device between GPIOs and 'HC595. I
don't know if pretending there is some extra hardware (just to use
another Linux driver/layer) is a good idea. This would:
1) Not match hardware design
2) Involve some extra code.

I'm not even sure if this would work out-of-the box (without some
extra changes) at all. From early look at spi-gpio.c I can't see it
implementing everything I need for GPIO-connected 'HC595.
I think that implementing support for this extra SPI layer will
actually require more code/tricks than a separated driver.
