This kind of GPIO IRQ multiplexer doesn't really seem to match any use case
covered by the GPIO / IRQ subsystems. Especially the needed dynamic mapping
from the GPIOs to one of the eight GPIO GIC IRQs is tricky.

After Jerome's attempt from last year (using hierarchical IRQ domains) didn't
make it due to concerns of the maintainers, I decided to go another way.
I'm not stating at all that this is the right one ..

To re-use existing stuff as far as possible I go with GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP.
So far I use one irqchip per gpiochip (we have two of them).
I'll check whether I can use just one irqchip for both gpiochips.

I think this is one of the central questions here, whether this device
can be considered an irq controller.
It just manages routing of IRQs, so I'd tend to say that the gpio controller
is the irq controller with the GIC as parent.
