*gasp* I thought ACPI was the magic that would fix all issues with cure
embedded hacks.

Well, Hans already posted such patch for select x86 platforms with
Silead touchscreens. I am sure these platforms have more warts that
could be added to the same file in platform/x86/...

The drivers might care about ACPI enumerations, but they do not care
about warts of particular platform that chose to implement their ACPI
tables with missing or invalid data. I say that such knowledge should
not go into generic driver, but rather some other entity that woudl fix
up whatever wrong the platform did. It could be an ACPI table override,
or block of code in platform/x86/..., DT overlay, it does not really
matter as long as we do not litter drivers with hacks for random boxes.

Yes, we used to do that (DMI tables, etc), because there was no better
alternative. Now that we have generic device properties, we have better
ways of addressing these issues.

Thanks.
