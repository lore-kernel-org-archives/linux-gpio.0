Indeed this was one of the goals of this series. I can understand were
we came from and that we had those in-kernel tables in the past.
I am just a bit worried that with Allwinner recently playing the SKU
game we end up with tons of tables for only slightly different SoCs (see
the H3 and H5, for instance). And with single image kernels we pile up
quite some *data* in each kernel, which is of little interest for
everyone else.

Also my understanding is that the actual Allwinner pin controller IP
(register map) is very much the same across all SoCs. Mostly the only
difference is the mapping between pins and mux functions, which we
express in the DT already anyway (in the subnodes). And this is really a
poster book example of what DT should be doing: express the specific
mappings of a particular implementation. I don't see why this would need
to be per-board only, if we can pull this up to the SoC level.

The point is that we already rely on the DT anyway, just that we use a
*string* to specify a certain mux function. The in-kernel table just
maps this to an actual SoC-specific register value. I think the GPIO
subsystem needs the name, hence I am just adding the pinmux property.

Well, does that mean that we should never change anything? Consistency
is nice, but should not be an excuse for not improving things. And I
tried to embrace the existing driver by designing this on top of it.

Thanks for the pointer, I will have a look.

I don't see how this binding would make this worse.

Cheers,
