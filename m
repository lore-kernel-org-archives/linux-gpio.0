At the time I wrote that patch, the ACPI tables exposed all of the 
GPIOs, even the ones it didn't care about.  The new ACPI tables list 
only specific GPIOs, and so we no longer need to blindly read the 
direction of all GPIOs.

That makes a lot more sense.

I have that in patch #1.

I would be in favor of either reverting that patch, or moving the code 
into gpiochip_add_pin_range().

I do hate having to hack up the driver to support crappy ACPI 
definitions, but I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.
