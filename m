It's debatable. Ranges would be possible but there are a lot of gaps.
Personally, speaking as someone who has to maintain these drivers, I
like that fact that I can look at this file and see exactly which regis=
ters
are readable and volatile because they are all explicitly listed. It's =
also
useful that the files are searchable for specific registers.

I'll point Charles at this to get his opinion.
