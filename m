That is an example, but there are really many possibilities.

Basically, if a registered interrupt handler wants to access its GPIO
you are likely to run into trouble.  Another example might be an
interrupt that is configured to trigger on either edge transition and
the handler wants to know whether the input is currently high or low.

I can submit a V2 with a change in the description if you would like,
but I'm not sure what the clearest example would be.
