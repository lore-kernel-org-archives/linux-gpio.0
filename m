Both of these options also require that you be able to reset the device
which isn't possible with all devices and systems.

Right, I don't see an urgent problem either - if the tables were
complicated to think about it'd be a bit different but they aren't
particularly and like you say there's tradeoffs both at runtime and
at development time for trying to make the source code smaller.

Equally if there are useful things we can add to the API for some use
cases I'm all for that so long as they don't get in the way of other
users, most of the extensions in the API have come from someone having
problems and coming up with a fix that meets their needs.
