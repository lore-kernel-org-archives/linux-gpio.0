I don't really understand this. In both cases we are dealing with pin muxing
and that belongs in the pin control subsystem. What register range the stuff
is in and whether it is called "GPIO block" in the datasheet does not concern
me, it is a pin controller from the point of the view of the kernel subsystems,
if it can multiplex pads/pins.
