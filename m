Okay, got it.
I'll file a bug about this issue to the the bugzilla. However something
tells me it might not be cpuidle, but D-link. This one's sounds nasty
and it has been around since 3.16.x. How could it go unnoticed?
Unfortunately I have no other armada-370 hardware to test it.

As far I got - stock u-boot knows nothing about partition tables and
operates just on raw NAND offsets.

Sorry, I had to resend that email twice. First one to you, next to the=20
list
and others. I'm quite new to LKML so still playing with proper email=20

I only have a chance to play with the hardware at the weekend, since th=
e
spare dns327l is at the country house, so I try to send fixes as soon a=
s
get feedback while I can quickly test it.
