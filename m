Well I don't know if this use case as already been considered. I
understand you don't want to be overwhelmed by interrupts but why not
using the interrupt to start polling the PDSR (Pin Data Status
Register)?

I am really not confortable about exposing the ISR since there is a
clean on read. You have taken precautions by checking the IMR before but
if there is a single driver using a gpio as an irq, you will never get
the ISR.
