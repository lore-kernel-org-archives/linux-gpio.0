Dear Arnd,

Pls see my answer below:

APM:  There are 6 GPIOs which can support IRQ, they are fixed to use
external IRQ from XGIC.  (The XGIC is based on the ARM Generic
Interrupt Controller Architecture Specification, Architecture version
2.0, The XGIC provides the mechanism to collect interrupt requests
(IRQs) from both on-chip as well as off-chip sources and deliver them
to the multiple X-Gene1 cores within the X-Gene1 processor),  So there
are no way to read the GPIO DS when configure as an interrupt. They
are specific GPIO for boot another boot chip in X-Gene which can
access when boot up. So this is hardwire in the GPIO block.
GPIO_DS8 ---> External IRQ0 (XGIC40)
GPIO_DS9 ---> External IRQ1 (XGIC41)
...
GPIO_DS13 ---> External IRQ5(XGIC45)
