Thank you very much.

The back end request was for tegra-gpio, not for this. On Tegra GPIO the 
open drain configurations are in different register space i.e. pin 
control register space instead of gpio controller.

In this driver, it is configuration via pinctrl. Here pincontrol and 
gpio driver share same registers.
Now, as we have the method to configure the open drain bit from the GPIO 
interface, we really dont need to do this from pinctrl framework.

For doing from GPIO framework, the client need to aware that gpio is 
open drain type.

Can we make something that open drain of pins can be provided via some 
common interface like DT of controller based on platforms configuration  
and client need not to worry about this? For client, it will be simple 
gpio calls.
