This is not the point, but rather: if we have a way to detect easily
that the device tree is missing a property that is missing in our
binding, why shouldn't we do it?

We're already doing it for reg and interrupts for example, why not for
the clocks?

Riiiight, because it worked so well in the past. We definitely didn't
overlooked some clocks used for debouncing in this particular driver,
or some to get the timekeeping right in the RTC.

The argument that "anyone who codes in the kernel should just know
better" doesn't work, on multiple levels. Because anyone that actually
knows better can make a mistake or overlook some feature (because you
didn't have your morning coffee yet, or because it was undocumented)
and because you just make someone that doesn't feel bad.

So, yes, we cannot not trust the device tree. But if we have a way to
detect simple mistakes in the binding, we should also do it.
