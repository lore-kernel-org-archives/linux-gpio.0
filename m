Hello,

(I'm sort of answering both of yours and Linus' questions)

Understood. I have to rebase my series anyway since Linus Walleij alrea=
dy
merged two related patches (the bugfix and the rename patch). For the n=
ew
series I'll put the binding on the top.

Ok, maybe here's part of the problem. I'm thinking that the GPIOs devic=
es
I'm referring to:
	MyBook Live
	brcm63xx (which is a popular router SoC so there are many boards)

are the same common class: "memory-mapped gpio". It's is a bit
unfortunate that the linux driver file name was gpio-generic.c. (But
this since been fixed... actually funny thing is that it started as:
basic_mmio_gpio.c)

The important bit is that, when I looked around: there is was already
an existing device binding in the form of a platform_device called:
"basic-mmio-gpio" [0].

    gpio: add driver for basic memory-mapped GPIO controllers
   =20
    The basic GPIO controllers may be found in various on-board FPGA an=
d ASIC
    solutions that are used to control board's switches, LEDs, chip-sel=
ects,
    Ethernet/USB PHY power, etc.
   =20
    These controllers may not provide any means of pin setup
    (in/out/open drain).
   =20
    The driver supports:
    - 8/16/32/64 bits registers;
    - GPIO controllers with clear/set registers;
    - GPIO controllers with a single "data" register;
    - Big endian bits/GPIOs ordering (mostly used on PowerPC).

And there are a users of this "basic-mmio-gpio" interface:
arch/arm/mach-s3c64xx/mach-crag6410.c
arch/arm/mach-omap1/board-ams-delta.c
arch/arm/mach-imx/mach-mx21ads.c
arch/arm/mach-clps711x/board-p720t.c
arch/arm/mach-clps711x/board-autcpu12.c

to that end: The patch series proposed by Mr. Fern=E1ndez simply added =
a
device-tree-parser for translating the fdt into a bgpio_pdata platform
structure and use the existing interface with the same "basic-mmio-gpio=
"
compatible string. So unless steps are taken to remove or rename this
"basic-mmio-gpio" interface there will be patches like this (in your in=
boxes).
[I know: It's a silly idea to actually touch it, as it'll break compati=
bility]

Well, I think this has been trainwrecked enough. But there's a way out:
I would really like to preserve the bgpio_basic_mmio_parse_dt so probab=
ly
going to introduce a "wd,mbl-gpio" binding for my own hardware and let=20
potential new user be able to reuse the generic dt parser. This will cu=
t
down on the work required to add a device. As they will only need to ad=
d
an compatible entry to of_device_id list of the driver like this:
	"brcm,bcm63xx-gpio", bgpio_basic_mmio_parse_dt

Will this work for you Linus, Rob and Mark?

That said, I'm still going through the rest of the post. As some of the
issues are still relevant for the "wd,mbl-gpio" as well.

No, sadly they can't be (commit log above). The basic_mmio_gpio
device only supports 8/16/32/64 bits registers and you only can
have one register.=20

In a nutshell, the basic_mmio_gpio is a glorified
io(read|write)(8|16|32|64)[be] interface. And that's what makes it appe=
aling.
It won't be long until someone clobbers together gpiohog, gpio-led,
gpio-key-polled, led-triggers definitions and implements a full turing =
machine
within a fdt just for the fun of it.

There's a paragraph in the driver:
"For the single output register, this drives a 1 by setting a bit and a=
 zero
by clearing a bit.  For the set clr pair, this drives a 1 by setting a =
bit
in the set register and clears it by setting a bit in the clear registe=
r.
The configuration is detected by which resources are present."

I'll add that to the binding.

About dirin/dirout. There can only be either be one of the two.
dirin: 1 =3D GPIO is input, 0 =3D GPIO is output
dirout: 1 =3D GPIO is output, 1 =3D GPIO is input

Sadly the resource names are part of the original commit. It's not poss=
ible
without adding a resource rename step in the dt parser or breaking=20
compatibility with existing interface. So, the question would be: which=
 one
do you actually want or better yet: "what can we agree on?".

Ok. I'll add that.

I looked up the proper CS terms:=20
"big-endian-byte-order: assign GPIOs in MSB 0 bit numbering order."
(The default is: LSB 0 bit numbering)

Yes. That said the MyBook Live only has a bidirectional "dat" register
and 8 bit for GPIOs (this simplifies a lot of things).

Unless of course, we can somehow agree on the generic approach.
