I think that's a different issue, because debouncing is an optional
feature. How would those kind of explicit molly guards here have
prevented this omission in the past, when we only discovered that later?

I agree to that. But: If something doesn't work, checking clocks and
reset would be my first impulse. And Icenowy did exactly that and
quickly found it.
Plus this only protects against known pitfalls.

I totally honour that, I am just wondering what price we pay for that.
This kind of: "We need three clocks here, or wait, two clock in this
particular case" sounds a bit dodgy and little future proof to me.
Which is somewhat confirmed by the fact that we need to adjust this
check now. So I suggest we remove it, as we have more, actual checks
afterwards anyway. That should cover future extensions without further ado:
The clock-names property should cater nicely for those cases, hence my
suggestion to rely on it. Plus we need to support the legacy DTs with
just a single clock and no clock-names. Done.
So I think we should change the devm_get_clk(..., NULL) to
devm_get_clk(..., "apb"), and then check for just a single unnamed clock
if that fails (older DTs), or no clock at all, if we need to support
future SoCs without debouncing.

Looking deeper I actually think we are not binding compliant at the
moment, as we rely on the "apb" clock to be the first one, however
clock-names = "hosc", "losc", "apb" would be perfectly legal as well, as
we don't document a certain order of the clock - which is not necessary
with clock-names.

I can make a patch if we agree on that.

Cheers,
Andre.
