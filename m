Good improvements since last iteration!

Insert your explanations about domain pads and system

Hm I still don't fully understand this property.

So what you mean is that there is a special register for the sleep
mode, so that we do not need to write the sleep mode explicitly,
it will instead hit the hardware automatically when the system
switches to sleep mode on some global level?

Please detail this.

This is not a spreadtrum-specific feature. Look for example in:
include/dt-bindings/pinctrl/nomadik.h

We have things like this:

#define SLPM_DISABLED           0
#define SLPM_ENABLED            1
#define SLPM_INPUT_NOPULL       0
#define SLPM_INPUT_PULLUP       1
#define SLPM_INPUT_PULLDOWN     2
#define SLPM_DIR_INPUT          3
#define SLPM_OUTPUT_LOW         0
#define SLPM_OUTPUT_HIGH        1
#define SLPM_DIR_OUTPUT         2
#define SLPM_WAKEUP_DISABLE     0
#define SLPM_WAKEUP_ENABLE      1

These (also custom) properties predate the generic pin config,
and that is why it was done like this.

But moving forward, we may need to think about coming up with
something generic for this.

I think this kind of overlaps the pin control states "default"
and "sleep".

What we want to do is read out both "default" and "sleep" modes
from the device tree and program *both* into the hardware
when "default" is normally initialized.

This is better, because then the device tree looks the same
whether we use hardware-backed switch from "default" to
"sleep" and back or not.

I don't know how to do this practically unfortunately, it may need
some modifications of the pin control core code so that drivers
can get the "sleep" mode configuration out and program it.

OK

Do not use this. The generic bias-pull-up already supports an
argument.

Use this:

bias-pull-up = <20000>;
bias-pull-up = <4700>;

Just unpack the argument in the .set_config() callback and deny
it setting anything else than 20000 or 4700 Ohms.

OK

Uncertain on this.

Switch to bias-pull-up as per above.

This is not good. We need to handle these using the standard

input-enable
output-enable
bias-pull-up
bias-pull-down

Just inside a state named "sleep" and then let the driver read and program
this state into the sleep registers at first convenience.
