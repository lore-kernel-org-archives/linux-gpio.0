Largely the point. How long do you think it would take to populate the
cache if you had to read thousands of registers over I2C? Boot time matters.
Deferring it until it's touched can create various unpredictable and
annoying behaviour later, for example if a lot of cache entries are
written while the chip is asleep and the initial values weren't known
then a suspend/resume cannot filter out writes that are setting the
register to its default (which regmap does to avoid unnecessary bus traffic).
So the resume could have a large amount of unnecessary overhead writing
registers to a value they already have or reading the initial values of
those registers.

Not a valid generalization. And it's not a question of sanity, the purpose
of the register and the overhead to setup a use-case also matter.
There are many reasons why the default of a register might not be zero.
Take a look at drivers/mfd/wm5110-tables.c, a lot of the registers don't
have a default of zero (and that's only the registers accessed by the driver.)
It's particularly true of registers that affect things like voltage and
current sources, zero might be a very inappropriate default - even dangerous.
Also enable bits, if some things must power-up enabled and others don't, unless
you want a chip that has a confusing mix of inverted and non-inverted enable
bits. Another side to this is to reduce the number of writes to enable _typical_
behaviour - if an IP block has say 100 registers and you have to write all of
them to make it work that's a lot of overhead compared to them defaulting to
typical values used 99.9% of the time and you only need to write one or two
registers to use it.

   Then default values can be changed at the leisure of the

Potentially with a lot of overhead, especially on those chips with thousands
of registers to set to useful non-zero values before you can use it.

Lochnagar doesn't have that many registers but convention and consistency also
comes into play. Regmap is used in a particular way and it helps people a lot
if every driver using it follows the convention.

If you aren't happy with the regmap subsystem you could send some
patches to change it to what you would be happy with (and patch the ~1300
drivers that use it)

Like any kernel subsystem it has an API that we have to obey to be able to
use it.

In my opinion a lot of the source code in Linux is much uglier than
these tables.

If we could add support for new devices by removing lines of code that
would be cool :). Eventually Linux would support every piece of hardware
and be zero lines of code.

To re-iterate, regmap is a standard kernel subsystem. It's not owned by Cirrus,
so it's not our responsibility if you don't like it. Mark Brown is the maintainer.

Submit your patches to Mark and the owners of those ~1300 drivers to propose
changes to regmap that you would be happy with.

As above, if one subsystem owner doesn't like another subsystem then those
subsystem owners should talk to each other and sort something out. It shouldn't
block patches that are just trying to use the subsystem as it currently exists
in the kernel.
