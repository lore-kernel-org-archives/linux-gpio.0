No worries, we're in the discussion and 'supposedly' was a meaningful

Sorry, I have no idea about the ath10k calibration data and its
connection to the GPIO framework.

Ok, I'll meditate on it.

Generally it might be a good option, because if GPIOs are essentially
needed to be preset, I can conclude there are some ICs to which these
GPIOs are connected, thus drivers of these ICs can become GPIO consumers
and get a proper description in a board DTB.

As I read it from Documentation/gpio/sysfs.txt generic interface(s)
to control GPIOs is a last resort, it is not clear if you want a new
feature for all possible consumers or just userspace consumers.
