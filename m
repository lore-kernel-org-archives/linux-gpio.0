I've now actually attempted to use the gpiolib irqchip code.  This
driver can't directly use gpiochip_irqchip_add() because of the
multiple gpiochip : one irqchip map.  At first, I thought it might be
possible to simply add a new argument (or break things into a helper
function) to allow setting the associated IRQ domain, but then I can't
use the generic map and unmap functions which expect the irq_domain
host_data member to be struct gpiochip *, which makes no sense in this
case.  That puts me right back to implementing a special version of
the map and unmap function.

Since there doesn't appear to be any benefit to using the gpiolib
irqchip code for this case, I'm going to stick with my implementation
from patch 3 of this patchset.  I've also added to it to allow for
using the GPIOs as a wakeup source, and will submit that as well with
V2.

Thanks,
Gregory
