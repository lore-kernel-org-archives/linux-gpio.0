It is an irq_chip. Would you therefore prefer a different name or another location
for this binding documentation?

Has been removed already in v2 of the patch.

This HW is somewhat special, it's more or less a multiplexer between
100+ GPIO's and 8 GIC IRQ's. And we have two GPIO domains, both having
a "gpio-controller".
It doesn't seem that the "interrupt-controller" property is right here.
I'd tend to say it should be added to the "gpio-controller" nodes.

This relates to previous comment, as it isn't really an interrupt
controller I'm not sure we should use this name.
