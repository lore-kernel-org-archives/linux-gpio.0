OK.  I have a couple of questions.

What's the overhead/effect on Windows for an ACPI object without a _HID (_ADR
only)?  That seems like a case where the OS shouldn't be expecting to load
another driver for the ACPI object and the _ADR gives each node a unique name
(even if it is an unfriendly integer)

Do you expect there to be cases where using an ACPI device object is more
desirable than hierarchical properties?  Or is it just impossible given the PNP
manager in Windows?

The best example I can think of is perhaps a multi function device where each
sub-function really does look like a separate device and you probably want to
reference that sub-device, as a device, in other ASL code.

Stating the above more generally, by taking this approach you loose the ability
to reference these child nodes as a device object.  In this LED example, I
think it would be nice to set the "trigger" for the led by adding a reference
to the LED from another device (such as a NIC).

Device (NIC0)
{
    ...
    Name (_DSD, Package () {
        ToUUID("daffd814-6eba-4d8c-8a91-bc9bbf4aa301"),
        Package () {
            Package () {"activity-led", LEDS.LEDM },
            Package () {"link-led", LEDS.LEDH },
        },
    }
}

I'm not sure that's even supported in devicetree or LEDs are the best example
of this, but the pattern seems generally useful.

Without a device you're also forced to use a "label" property instead of a
_STR.

I guess LEDH and LEDM have to be strings here.  It would be nice if the
compiler could verify the path resolves.  I suppose it's more incentive to keep
these in the same scope.

I suspect you've thought of all of this.  Thanks in advance for any
explanations.
