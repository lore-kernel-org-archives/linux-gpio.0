I'd love to see a switchdev driver but it's a huge task (and no I'm not =

committing to writing it). As it stands Marvell ship a switch SDK =

largely executes in userspace with a small kernel module providing some =

linkage to the underlying hardware.

We (a few of us here at Allied Telesis NZ) have discussed switchdev and =

how we get from using Marvell's SDK in our products to using switchdev =

proper.

The first step would probably be some kind of trampoline driver which =

communicates with a userspace helper to do the actual work. =

Alternatively there is some support in Marvell's SDK for compilation as =

a binary blob so a proprietary kernel module is another option. Neither =

of these are particularly nice in a free software world.

A full "free" implementation would be a large undertaking. Ideally I'd =

like to see Marvell involved with producing one but so far they've not =

been interested whenever I've brought it up.
