Right. And actually this would work without any DT annotation, altough
it might take a few more loops to get to the right order.

But as Maxime confirmed later, his device is more like this:

/* Contains both banks A and B */
gpio: gpio {
        compatible =3D "foo,gpio-controller";
        bankb-supply =3D <&GPIO_REGULATOR>'
};

GPIO_REGULATOR: gpio-regulator {
        compatible =3D =E2=80=9Cgpio-regulator=E2=80=9D;
        gpio =3D <&gpio 14>;
};

And here there is nothing we can do, I'm afraid, without splitting the
banks into their own nodes first.
