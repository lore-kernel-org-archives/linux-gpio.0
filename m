No, that wasn't necessary.  Will change to just read the register.

OK, I will move it to the patch that does.

This was needed to deal with having a single irq_chip shared across
all of the gpio_chips in a GIO block.  You mentioned that this might
not be the Right Way to do this in your reply on the cover page so
I'll try to explain the reasoning better there.

FWIW: yes, this is inside the first bank's bgpio_chip, and it would be
possible to extract that info.  However, since it is used in
- brcmstb_gpio_to_irq
- brcmstb_gpio_hwirq_to_offset
- brcmstb_gpio_irq_bank_handler
- brcmstb_gpio_of_xlate

It seemed like it would be easier to follow if this were just stored
this in the priv struct, even if it is duplication of information.

Will change the name to MAX_GPIO_PER_BANK.

That is what I did originally.  However, this results in a very
unpleasant numbering scheme, at least as currently implemented.

When -1 is base, as you know, numbering goes descending from 255
(IIRC).  Right now I'm using the of_property_for_each_u32 loop over
bank widths to go through the banks.  To keep the example
straightforward, let's pretend our GIO block only has two banks.
Here's how they're arranged:

bank 0: starts at 0xf040a700, contains GPIOs 0-31
bank 1: starts at 0xf040a720, contains GPIOs 32-63

Right now, with -1 as base, calling gpiochip_add() inside of that loop
will results in them getting this numbering:

bank 0: linux GPIOs 224-255
bank 1: linux GPIOs 192-223

which has the obvious downside that the ordering doesn't at all match
the hardware, making it completely unintuitive for anyone using the
(admittedly quite awful) sysfs interface.

Looking at this now, I think I could just add another loop afterward
to do the gpiochip_add()'s in reverse order, resulting in the
numbering ascending with banks as expected.  Does this seem sensible?

You're right, probably better to have that be an error.  Will change that.

I'll be getting rid of imask anyway as you suggested.  But since you
mentioned it, I just realized that the register specification says
that reads of the reserved bits can return an unknown value but writes
of those bits should be 0.  While in practice it doesn't seem to cause
any problems, I'll change that anyway just to be safe.

(this was covered above)

Thanks for the review,
