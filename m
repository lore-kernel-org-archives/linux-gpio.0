Regulator/GPIO has two states, enable and disable. If sleep mode is 
configured for these resource and external signal triggers to sleep then 
this get disabled.

My bad, I did but mixed with technical ignorance. Will try best.

Hmm..
Does it look fine:
There is 8 slots for each FPS on which resource can get enabled. This 
property provides the slot number on which resource gets enabled after 
FPS sequence started.

Which property? Saw sleep property with vendor prefix.
