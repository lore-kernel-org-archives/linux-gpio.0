Hm, agree, we should consider to move
imx_pmx_gpio_request_enable/disable_free and imx_pmx_gpio_set_direction
into pinctrl-vf610.c

In Vybrid, there is no need to explicitly assign a pinmux to use a pin
as GPIO. So the pinmux could be anything... The implemented semantics
for Vyrbid is really different than i.MX, see below.

That sounds weird, what is the GPIO_PDDR for then? Sure I  need to
enable the output driver to drive the pin, but can I disable output just
using GPIO_PDDR?

Maybe we have a miss understanding here:

Lets assume we want to switch a GPIO between output and input:

echo "output" > /sys/class/gpio/gpioN/direction
..
echo "input" > /sys/class/gpio/gpioN/direction

Do I need to disable the output driver in the IOMUXC or can we just
disable GPIO_PDDR and use the pin as input?

If we can disable the output driver just using GPIO_PDDR, we can avoid
the gpio_set_direction cross call.

I suggest to read this clarification email wrt to pinctrl/gpio from
Linus Walleij:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/10/10/87

To summarize: We have different semantics in Vybrid: The GPIO subsystem
automatically mux the GPIO for you. So in Vybrid, you do not have to mux
a GPIO (but a valid entry in your device tree is needed, but does not
assigned to any node).

Is what the driver is doing for Vybrid wrong? It is different from i.MX,
but afaik, it is not really wrong... Its a valid implementation
according to the currently defined semantics...  Due to the *need* to
touch pinctrl for direction, I had to implement cross calls anyway, so I
thought I might as well go full mile and also mux the GPIO on request...

So the question is, what semantic do we want for i.MX 7ULP? Since it is
a i.MX device, we probably want the same semantics as i.MX 6/7 is
already using for the sake of consistency. So in this case the
gpio_request_enable/disable callbacks are not needed...

This is how I hope we can do the implementation for i.MX 7ULP:
- Do not use gpio_request_enable/disable
- Do not use gpio_set_direction either
- Users using a GPIO should enable output driver in IOMUXC (just use a
pin configuration where output driver is enabled)
- The GPIO driver only enables/disables the output driver using its
GPIO_PDDR register depending on GPIO direction
