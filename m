My recommendation when the tables get in the way of the rest of the
driver is to move them into a separate file that contains only tables,
these get big but they're sitting in a separate file that only contains
big data tables so they're fairly simple to look at (and generate or
whatever) and people working on the active code don't need to look at
them.

There are volatile registers which can't be part of the cache as the
hardware might change the state, and we have things like device
identification registers which are fixed but which we want to read from
the device.  This second set of registers can usually be modelled quite
happily as volatile registers though, we don't tend to read them often.

There's also registers where the user just didn't tell us what's going
on, either through oversight or because there's some code that touches
undocumented test registers at runtime for quirk reasons using a read,
modify write cycle.  We could try to insist that the device drivers
always provide a default or mark things as volatile but that's likely to
be an uphill struggle and more error prone.

You can provide the writability information either with the function or
with data.  The tables code doesn't currently scale very well to large,
sparse register maps but that could in theory be optimized.  Few devices
bother providing distinct writability information as it's not often an
issue.
