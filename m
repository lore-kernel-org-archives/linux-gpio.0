My suggestion of &gpio-map or "gpio-map" was just shooting from
the hip.  After going back to the DT connector thread, I have
a different answer of &gpio1 instead of &connector:

    reset-gpios = <&gpio1 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

The full answer in more than changing &connector to &gpio1, see
below for the fuller dts.


I took David Gibson's initial socket / plug proposal[1], and added
in the gpios from Stephen's proposal.

[1] https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/7/18/332


-----  Socket:

/dts-v1/;

/ {
	compatible = "foo,oldboard";
	ranges;
	soc@... {
		ranges;
		mmio: mmio-bus@... {
			#address-cells = <2>;
			#size-cells = <2>;
			ranges;
		};
		i2c: i2c@... {
		};
		intc: intc@... {
			#interrupt-cells = <2>;
		};
	};

	connectors {
		widget1 {
			compatible = "foo,widget-socket";
			w1_irqs: irqs {
				interrupt-controller;
				#address-cells = <0>;
				#interrupt-cells = <1>;
				interrupt-map-mask = <0xffffffff>;
				interrupt-map = <
					0 &intc 7 0
					1 &intc 8 0
				>;
			};
			w1_gpio1: gpio1 {
				#gpio-cells = <1>;
				gpio-map = <0 &soc_gpio1 1 0>,
				<1 &soc_gpio2 4 0>,
				<2 &soc_gpio1 3 0>,
				<3 &soc_gpio2 2 0>;
				gpio-map-mask = <0xf>;
			};
			aliases = {
				i2c = &i2c;
				intc = &w1_irqs;
				mmio = &mmio;
				gpio1 = &w1_gpios1;
			};
		};
	};
};


-----  Expansion board:

/dts-v1/;

/plugin/ foo,widget-socket {
	compatible = "foo,whirligig-widget";
};

expansion_device {
	reset-gpios = <&gpio1 2 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
};

&i2c {
	whirligig-controller@... {
		...
		interrupt-parent = <&widget-irqs>;
		interrupts = <0>;
	};
};
