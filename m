I figured out this is more "pinctrl-imx.c" than "device-tree" related
so I am kindly adding maintainers of that file in hope somebody will
shed some light to it.

I am diving deeper into the code and it seems there really is no generic
option to set the i.MX6 pad group control registers from device tree.
Or am I looking at the problem from a wrong angle?

How should we deal with boards that need to configure some pad
characteristics available only through the pad group control registers?

I also raised this question at the NXP community forum [1] and get quite
unsatisfying answer so far. I would love to find/implement a proper
and universal solution.

Thanks in advance for your time,
Michal
