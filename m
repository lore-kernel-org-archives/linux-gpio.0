The current driver is indeed not designed for multiple instances of the
same pinctrl controller. But that's exactly what Russell is asking for.

This definitely shouldn't be called "pm_info", because 'base' is not PM
related. It should be mvebu_pinctrl_state or something like that.

Does not work because "mvebu_pinctrl_pm_info" cannot be a generic
structure, it has to be a per-SoC driver structure, since the set of
registers to save for PM reasons is different from one SoC to the
other. Also, some SoC have only one "base" pointer, some others (like
Dove) have multiple.

So it should be the other way around: the SoC-specific driver create a
structure, and this structure points back to the mvebu_pinctrl
structure.
