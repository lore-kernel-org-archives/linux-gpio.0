My point was that with gpio line names (and possibly topological
information to resolve duplicates), the N number should not matter
anymore.

[ It was also a comment to a comment made earlier in the thread were the
use case was said to be to "control GPIO48 with /sys/class/gpio/gpio48".
And it seems we are in agreement there. ]

If one needs to look up a particular gpiochip based on some hardware
naming convention, why not associate a name with the chip instead of
trying to shoehorn the dynamic gpiochip range in there?

Again, it seems we're on the same page here.

And this may even be unavoidable with dynamic buses such as USB or
greybus, where you can have multiple devices associating the same name
with a pin. That's fine as long as the user-space interface allows for a
way to distinguish them (e.g. through topological information).
