This is still a different driver from the tps68470 driver which is an MFD
driver. For clarity, I'd keep pmic as part of the name (and I'd use
tps68470_pmic_ prefix for internal symbols, too).

As PMICs are typically linked to the kernel (vs. being modules), there's no
issue with the module name. I would suppose few if any PMICs will be
compiled as modules in general.

It's not a big deal though. I'm fine either way.
