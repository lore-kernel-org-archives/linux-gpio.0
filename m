Oh by the way: who's maintaining them? get_maintainer.pl just
lists the usual gpio people. I can try to add the module authors.
However, I don't know if these are working or dead. I ran into an
issue once (for something else) that I got the dreaded "delivery
notification failed" messages, but I can't rebroadcast them on the
ML (because that would be very silly).

Anyway, I'll rebase my patch series (without the two patches you
had already merged)

Oh, this is a RFC. I didn't expect anything to be merged just yet.
Of course, I'll try to integrate his suggestion. I'll do that once
I reply to Rob/Mark/You about the "linux,gpio-mmio",
"memory-mapped-gpio" situation etc.
