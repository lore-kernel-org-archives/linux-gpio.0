This was my fault. I decided to reword the patch and changed 
the subject among a few other things. So, this patch was sent
to the ML twice.

Bjorn commented that he has some comments.
<http://www.spinics.net/lists/devicetree/msg176168.html>

Unfortunately, he didn't say what exactly needs to be changed.
So, I'm not really sure how to proceed.

@Bjorn: can you please tell what you would like to see changed?
I see what I can do about it. I do have access two a few IPQ4019/8
and can ask a few people to run tests.

@Rob:

I noticed that: 

qcom,apq8064-pinctrl.txt: pins, function, bias-disable, bias-pull-down, bias-pull,up, drive-strength,
qcom,ipq4019-pinctrl.txt: pins, function, bias-disable, bias-pull-down, bias-pull,up, drive-strength,
qcom,ipq8064-pinctrl.txt: pins, function, bias-disable, bias-pull-down, bias-pull,up, drive-strength,
qcom,msm8660-pinctrl.txt: pins, function, bias-disable, bias-pull-down, bias-pull,up, drive-strength,
qcom,msm8974-pinctrl.txt: pins, function, bias-disable, bias-pull-down, bias-pull,up, drive-strength.

all have the same "bias-pull,up". I think I'll just do
a separate patch for this to stop it from spreading :D.

Thanks,
Christian
