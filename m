I agree, and thus was proposing a _slightly changed_ pinctrl driver
which actually *reduces* the maintenance burden in the kernel.
In the moment we need to add _both_ a pinctrl .dtsi node _and_ a kernel
"driver" file, which is really boilerplate code plus a table.
Also we need to make sure that both these files match.
If a new SoC is really 99% similar to an existing one, atm we still need
explicit kernel support if only one pin is changed (see the H5).

So my idea was to basically add the mux value as a DT property, thus
making the kernel pinctrl-sun[x]i-a[yz].c files obsolete and greatly
_reduce_ the maintenance burden. Ideally there wouldn't be any pinctrl
code changes in the kernel for future SoCs anymore - at least if
Allwinner sticks with their current pace of releasing copy&pasted SoC
designs. Changes beyond that would require a driver change anyway, even
with the current model.

I gave Linus' proposal to use the pinctrl-single binding a quick look
and don't think it's a match for Allwinner SoC. So my idea was to
basically just add a new compatible and the muxsel property to the
existing driver and binding. It would basically look the same, apart
from one or two additions (to cover interrupts, for instance).
Any future SoCs could then just use that compatible and would describe
the SoC details in the DT, like it's meant to be and like we do already,
but extended by putting the mux value in there as well.
So the only kernel contribution would then be the DT, really, which
technically could be delivered on some device storage as well, but
that's a different discussion ...

Like I said above, I didn't mean to trash the current pinctrl binding,
just make it a bit more generic and simplify future kernel support.

Yet we did it for the clocks. The very same argumentation that you gave
above applies there as well (two different bindings, two sets of drivers
in the kernel, new learnings for people, etc.)
One difference would be that the new pinctrl binding wouldn't be
fundamentally different to the old one, up to the point where the old
driver could possibly use the very same DT nodes (but that would need to
be worked out).

Cheers,
Andre.
