In this specific case I'd keep both strings, it doesn't hurt does it?

You could add a comment to the wildcard string saying it is only there
for compatibility with elder device trees.

In general as long as there are not (a lot of) products shipped with
a certain device tree, I don't care much whether we change the bindings
or contents.

The hard rule to keep the device trees backward-compatible comes
from SPARC SunOS where the DTB was burned into a BIOS ROM
that was hard or impossible to update, Linux just had to handle
whatever was in there. If the situation with the device tree we change
is not similiar, we should not care either.

In practice there are companies and developers that always
recompile and ship their device trees at the same time as they
compile and ship their kernel, and in that case we need not care
about backward compatibility.

While the device tree enablement on ARM started out with the
former (strict) assumption, the practice of using DTs has shown
that it is an unrealistic and inappropriate stance to have for all
device trees. (IMO!) So I don't mind if you break compatibility here.

Yours,
