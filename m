To the best of my knowledge the ACPI spec does not explicitly mention pinctrl.
In another reply it was mentioned that there is work in progress for pinmuxing,
so evidently it is on the ASWG radar and within the scope of ACPI.

I was trying to point out that it is _implicitly_ firmware's responsibility to
do any pinctrl today, due to the ACPI model for power management, and the lack
of an existing ACPI mechanisms to provide pinctrl data.

In practice, firmware configures pinctrl at boot, and may modify pinctrl as
part of the runtime power management firmware is put in charge of.

The lack of any statement about pinctrl would mean that there is effectively no
reasonable limitation on what firmware might do with pinctrl, and we cannot
assume specific behaviour from the firmware.

Device power management and suspend/resume seem like the obvious cases.

Thanks,
