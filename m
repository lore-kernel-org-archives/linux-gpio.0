Hm :-/

I didn't realize this wasn't a quite so straight-forward a
syscon GPIO driver.

Now I start to think that it looks kludgy to bolt this onto
the other driver and think we may need to go back to the
other version which puts it as a separate driver. I guess
that is what you refer to as v1?

I have a hard time to make my mind up about these
syscon things, sorry :-(

Now I have to ask you: which way do you prefer to do it,
if you can choose freely? The initial driver or augmenting
the syscon driver (patch v1)?

Yours,
Linus Walleij
