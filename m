I do not need to convince anyone, I'm not into politics.

The way to attract users to the character device is by offering better
features... so we smack in the following goodies:

- Need a userspace ABI? No more need to select CONFIG_GPIO_SYSFS!
  The chardev is always there for any gpio chip in newer kernels!
  Board vendors would have to actively delete core code to disable it!

- Need open drain? The chardev will support that, the sysfs will never.

- Need to set/get multiple lines with a single context switch? Chardev
  does this. Also the set operation will turn into a single register write
  if your driver implements .set_multiple()

- All future needs: line biasing? Schmitt triggers? Drive strengths?
  All that will use the character device, and the sysfs ABI will never
  support any of it.

I have those that come with the kernel:

Then libgpiod as mentioned:
