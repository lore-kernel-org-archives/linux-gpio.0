The issue I've had in the past about the use of 'proper' interrupt
specifiers in DT for stuff that is represented as a hierarchy comes
mainly from the way Linux deals with those (unsurprisingly).

The DT parsing code will create a Linux interrupt each time it probes
an device that has these descriptors. That's all fine, except that for
a hierarchy, these output lines are not independent IRQs. We end-up
with double the interrupt descriptors at each level of the hierarchy,
which is both a waste of memory and a pain to debug. It also creates
all kind of bad problems as the interrupt is now registered in the
irqdomain, and I think this is what this patch is trying to work around.

Short of being able to tell the DT parser "don't map interrupts for this
device", we have two options: undo the mess when mapping a hierarchy,
or sidestep the issue altogether, which is what I've recommended in the
past (though Rob did disagree with me on that, and he has good
arguments too).

To be honest, I'd like to make progress on that too, if only to put
something in core code so that individual drivers don't have to play
that kind of game.

Thanks,

	M.
