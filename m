Second one is this patch only. Is it by intention?

The binding details about the gpio-switch and names are given by 
property "lable". I think property "label" is standard way of going 
forward i.e. I post similar patch for gpio-keys device name from DT 
after got review comment.

So here,  we can have the gpio names  under property "label" or "labels".


Or am I missing anything?
