The LED bindings represent devices attached to GPIO pins. This binding
appears to describe the GPIO pins themselves. There are already binding=
s
for the GPIO pins.

If there is information associated with the GPIO pins themselves, that
should be described in the GPIO bindings. If we want to export named
pins in sysfs, that is the duty of the GPIO framework and GPIO drivers.
I do not believe having a binding for a non-device that exists solely t=
o
express a naming preference makes any sense.

We have a similar issue with assigning names to serial devices, and the
approach taken there was to use an /aliases node. The same approach
might be applicable here, but I see no reason to have this binding.

Thanks,
Mark.
