I switched to the use of GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP however it didn't really simplify
my code, during the development on the v2 I did a commit only for this
change and here it is the diffstat:
110     72      drivers/pinctrl/mvebu/pinctrl-armada-37xx.c

In my first version I used the generic irqchip so I was able to benefit
of this framework, by switching to GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP I had to implement
again some of the functions such as .mask, .unmask an ack.

Thanks,

Gregory
