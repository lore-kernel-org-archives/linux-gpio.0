Ah, OK then. That kind of order makes sense as well.

But the next line is not aligned with the function call. So the 'strict'
is not followed and the code is less readable. Instead this should be
something like:

+			ret = max77620_regulator_set_power_mode(pmic
+					pmic->enable_power_mode[id],
					id);

You cannot align it with function call anyway (to many indentations and
too long name of function).

The other driver should support deferred probe and then the problem is
somehow solved. There are some rare cases when this does not work yet
but then please describe exactly which driver cannot work with it.

For example max77802 regulator works well.

Best regards,
