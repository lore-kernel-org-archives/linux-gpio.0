According to the documentation mask is a "precomputed bitmask for
accessing the chip registers" and it is exactly the way it is used in
this driver.

Moreover, currently ->mask is only used by the generic irqchip framework
and not by the core of the irqchip subsystem. So the mask initialization
is not done from the oustide but at the same level as the generic
irqchip which is not used here.

When I followed the functions called I never find a call to
irq_of_parse_and_map(), the closer things related to device tree I found
was:
"virq = irq_domain_alloc_descs(-1, 1, hwirq, of_node_to_nid(of_node),
NULL);"
