The number 256 was arbitrarily chosen.  I really wouldn't be surprised
if gpiochips with more pins exist, but they're probably rare, so using
the slowpath seems fine, but dropping support for them completely would
be a regression.

E.g. many serially attached chips such as MAX3191X are daisy-chainable
and the driver deliberately doesn't impose an upper limit on the number
of chips because the spec doesn't contain one either.  To the OS a
daisy-chain of such chips appears as a single gpiochip with many pins.

Thanks,

Lukas
