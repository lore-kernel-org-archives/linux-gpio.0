It can be argued that by the time the kernel boots, it is way to late to 
configure pins to a safe state. Of course, even secure world reads the 
DT these days (or are at least talking about doing so). Still any s/w 
handling this could be too slow to get to a safe state.

Maybe "optimal default" state would be more accurate.

I can't imagine that an output can't be an input. Regardless, what 
you're describing is constraints and that seems like a whole other 
problem than default/initial state.

Plus, for constraints I'd think we want this done at the pin level, not 
GPIO. And we kind of already have that with pin states.

"gpios" is already a defined property with a type (phandle + args). dtc 
checks for this now though gpio-hogs is already one exception, and I 
don't want to add another. Maybe it could be generalized to be allowed 
when the parent is a gpio-controller, but really I'd like to avoid this 
pattern from spreading.
