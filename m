Pardon me. How is this GENERAL PURPOSE Input/Output?

It seems very very much SPECIAL PURPOSE to me, it's like
you're just shoehorning some IPC mechanism into the GPIO
subsystem, and this may be because the datasheet calls it
GPIO when it's not.

What other stuff than DSP is connected to these lines, and is it
really even external lines? Aren't these just polysilicon rails
pretty much hammered to be used by the DSP and nothing else.

What is the difference between this and a mailbox IRQ line
and the kind of stuff handled by drivers/mailbox?

I'd like Suman and Jassi to have a look at this to see if it's
actually a mailbox before we proceed.

And if you proceed with this, please integrate it with
drivers/gpio/gpio-syscon.c, I don't need more special
syscons GPIO handlers.

Kconfig needs depends on MFD_SYSCON, right?
