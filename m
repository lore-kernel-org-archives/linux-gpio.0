Y could send a first version that does not support the IRQ lines
if he wants to speed up the process.

I think this case is different, from what I understand, the GPIO
controller cannot implement gpio_chip->get() for any line that
is connected to the GIC, and it has to ask the GIC instead.
This seems independent of the online/offline state of the controller.
