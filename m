How about merging max77802 to max77686 first? The only differences I
found are:
1. It uses main MFD/PMIC regmap.
   This can be solved as part of decoupling code. The driver will get
MFD's regmap and set up its own (only on max77686). The max77802 will
only use parent's regmap.

2. It has different register address.
   We need a register-layout/configuration structure. The logic is the
same except few differences (e.g. presence of MAX77802_RTC_AE1).

It may be easier to merge them now, before adding support for max77620?
I could handle this probably next week or in the following week
(assuming someone would test max77802 because I don't have the hardware).

Anyway I think we should develop these RTC patches having this in mind:
merge all of them.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
