I have a hard time choosing which errors should be ignored. For my
tests, I simply removed the error filtering at the end of
pinctrl_bind_pins, which works because devices with no pinctrl info are
already handled in the body of the function. It worked with my board,
but I am not sure that it covers all use cases. There are no hogs in
there, for example.

I wanted to have your opinion about the using a "strict-mapping"
property, as this property does not describe the hardware, but describes
the status of the device tree iself. From the rest of your mail, I
understand that your point of view is that it's not really needed.

I've sent the patch to Nicolas and the ARM mailing list, with cc to you.
See http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/2155589

In this precise case, the mapping for the ethernel interrupt is invalid
and skipped. It does not lead to a problem, because the line is mapped
later during the probe sequence to install the interrupt handler.

When I integrate mapping validation, the probing stops as soon as the
invalid mapping is detected, and the ethernet controller remains
unbound, without any loaded driver. As a result, the network interface
has disappeared. For someone who uses NFS for its rootfs, or anyone
using relying on the network to use the board, it is broken.


What I fear is that among the 300+ existing dts files that have a
"pinctrl-0" property, a fair proportion has an "invalid but working"
device tree, and the change of behaviour of the pinctrl driver will
break them. Hence my proposition to mark in the device trees those that
are known to work correctly.
