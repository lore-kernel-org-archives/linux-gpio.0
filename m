The chip support here the Flexible Power Sequence period (FPS period) as
40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280, 2560 and 5120 microseconds (for max77620)
20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280, 2560  microseconds (for max77620)

There is 3 bits in registers which defined as
000: 40us for max77620, 20us for max20024
001: 80us for max77620, 40us for max20024
010: 160us for max77620, 80us for max20024.
::

 From DT, I am getting the FPS period time as above and this loop is 
finding equivalent bit value (0 to 7) from period.

The min fps time is 40us for MAX77620 and 20us for MAX20024.
