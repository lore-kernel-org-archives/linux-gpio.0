Sure, I respect all comments and thanks for review.
Seems your mail got lost somewhere (still not seeing in my inbox).

This is require to
- configure FPS_SRC based on platform data for each rail,
     - If FPS_SRC enabled then enable it always.
     - If FPS_SRC is disabled (NONE) then based on init data constraint,
       set it to desired state.
- Power mode and slew rate init based on default configuration from the 
register if platform does not want to set it.
