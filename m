Yes, because one userspace app is controling out1 and the other out2.
And maybe /dev/gpio/, not sorted by chip, because out2 and out3 could b=
e another chip.
Just picked up unused gpio over soc and some added by SPI expander.
=46or example:
SOC -> board name
pioC18 -> in13
pioB12 -> in14
pioA31 -> out15
etc

I know that, just don't like /sys/class/leds/out15/brightness.

Hm, my inputs are simple digital inputs from real world, like "door ope=
n",
"somewhere is voltage", "some switch is on". And more than one app is r=
eading them.
So what to use for it?

Thanks
