In an effort to cleanup this driver and add Device Tree support
the driver has been rewritten based on new driver styles and
modern kernel driver helpers. This has nearly halved the lines
of code while keeping all previous functionality.

Platform file based initialization has been dropped as there is
no examples of this use in the kernel.

v1 can be found here: [1] v2: [2] v3: [3] v4: [4]

Changes from v4:
 - Use mfd core to add sub-devices

Changes from v3:
 - Reorganized regulator driver and related DT node
 - Other small fixes as discussed in v3 thread

Changes from v2:
 - Split the series further into subsystems

Changes from v1:
 - Split the rewrite into delete/create patches
 - Several small fixes as discussed in v1 thread
