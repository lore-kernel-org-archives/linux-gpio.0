See this patch set I just proposed: https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/3/31/334

Does it say anything at all about pinctrl management?

All very good points.

Since our focus is for open-ended configurations and for hardware that
it is not know to firmware we only considered the case where the pins
are not touched after the system boots.

Now I wonder what are the cases were the firmware changes the pin
configuration after boot.
