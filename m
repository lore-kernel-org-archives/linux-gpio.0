So basically:

 - first patch for adding pinctrl to the existing driver
 - second patch for moving the driver and binding from gpio to pinctrl
subsystem
 - third patch for both removing Kconfig entry and Makefile rule from
gpio subsystem, and adding a Kconfig entry and a Makefile rule in
pinctrl subsystem

Is that what you want?

Thanks,
Quentin
