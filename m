I'm working on a driver for a PMIC which uses a set of GPIO to select
a particular register. Right now I'm getting each GPIO independently
but Linus mentioned [0] the devm_gpio_request_array() patch you
posted.

Now, I'm not using the integer-based GPIO API but the new
descriptor-based one so I was wondering if you are already
implementing a devm_gpiod_get_array() or if you want me to implement
it myself.

Best regards,
Javier
