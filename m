Thanks for testing it. So, to sum-up, WFI+DeepIdle makes the board freeze
after a few hours in 4.1-rc1 and 4.0 for sure. Are you aware of any version
that did not freeze? It would help to know if it was a regression or not.

Andrew Lunn did not report any issue on his 370RD however I will test
it also on an other Armada 370 base board (a Mirabox) using the .config
you already sent.

But what I expect is either a hardware issue, or a hardware configuration
issue in U-Boot. We still rely a lot on the bootloader and I fear that
we have some implicit assumptions.

By the way do you have access on the bootloader sources or at least could
you give us the U-boot version used?

Thanks,

Gregory
