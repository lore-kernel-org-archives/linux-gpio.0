I agree with you that this is something that should be done in the driver 
and not in the lookup table. I think that it is still a good idea to have a 
replacement for gpio_request_one with the new GPIO descriptor API. A large 
share of the drivers want to call either gpio_direction_input() or 
gpio_direction_output() right after requesting the GPIO. Combining both the 
requesting and the configuration of the GPIO into one function call makes 
the code a bit shorter and also simplifies the error handling. Even more so 
if e.g. the GPIO is optional. This was one of the main reasons why 
gpio_request_one was introduced, see the commit[1] that added it.
