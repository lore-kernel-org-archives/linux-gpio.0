Admittedly yes, I guess it really comes down to use-cases.  There
are fairly strong use-cases to control GPIOs from user-space
that justify the risks. The use-cases for being able to set
non-persistent GPIOs from user-space seem less clear to me, but
if they exist I certainly don't have any objection.
