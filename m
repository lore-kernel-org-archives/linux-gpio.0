Where is that suniv prefix coming from?

And you need to have a SoC in all your compatibles. This isn't about
being clever or not, this is just a matter of being able to accurately
read in a crystal ball. Or maybe it's just the same, in which case,
I'd really like to have a course :)

You should really answer two questions here:
  - Are you able to predict whether you'll find an SoC part of that
    family in the future that derives a bit and will need a compatible
    of its own?
  - Are you able to predict which quirks we'll need along the way to
    support all the SoCs you've listed there?

If you can't answer yes to both these questions, with a 100%
certainty, then you'll need a SoC name in the compatible.

Which doesn't prevent you from sharing as much as possible the DT like
we did between the A10s and the A13 for example.
