Note I didn't target the kernel to implement this. I already have
patches that implement this in barebox which is also using dt. (After
all dt is about hardware description and not about what Linux should do,
right? :-)

It might make that line float which I'd consider "unsafe" (or "not
optimal").

Not 100% sure I'm up to date here, if you mean

	pinctrl-names = "default", "idle"
	pinctrl-0 = ... /* that's default */
	pinctrl-1 = ... /* that's idle */

this doesn't help completely. If the idle/save state means that the pin
should be configured as low-output, you cannot define that in general.
You can only configure the pin into its gpio function but not say it
should be an output driving the pin low.

I choosed the same way as gpio-hogs because IMHO they are quite similar.
Also if the propery is supposed to be located in a child node of a
gpio-controller, repeating &gpioX seems to be at least arguable.
