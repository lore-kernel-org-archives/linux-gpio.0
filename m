I know.

If you grep gpio drivers you will see that these gpio-zx, gpio-mvebu,
gpio-mxc, gpio-mxs, gpio-vf610 are using that.

Yes, it is about legacy application which I have seen recently and there
is no source code for application calls it because board vendor doesn't
provide it.

You are right that -1 was used from the beginning in mainline but
unfortunately this driver was in vendor tree for a while and it uses 0
there.

In upstreaming this was changed to -1 but customers have a lot of code
which developed against vendor tree and they want to use
latest&greatest. And without this they are not able to run that
applications.

I found that this logic is already in 5 drivers in mainline that's why I
send this patch to be +1.

Thanks,
Michal
