Thank you very much for acknowledgement.

I have posted patch V5 for enhancing DT binding doc as suggested by you 
and Lee. Request you to help on review.

I am going to send V6 to separate out DT binding doc patch with the 
driver file which I did in V5 and so want to correct if there is any 
more pending on document enhancement.
