This -map-mask and -map-pass-thru mechanism needs documentation in
Documentation/devicetree.  There's a bunch of users of -map-mask
(eg, interrupt-map-mask) but there's nothing that actually describes
how this works.

The "-map-pass-thru" thing also seems to be a new, undocumented idea.

So, NAK until this stuff goes through the same level of review WRT
DT documentation as other bindings are required to.

I'm not saying that it's a bad idea, but it's important for consistency
that this stuff is well documented, and people don't end up having to
interpret the code when writing their DT descriptions.
