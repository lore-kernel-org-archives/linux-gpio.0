Ah yes you're 100% right.

However I cannot name it "gpio-output-names" since that becomes
ever confusing: GPIO is both input and output (I remember we
discussed this at some point).

"gpio-line-names" was my best suggestion at the time,
I will respin the patch with that convention (how could I forget
this!).

Depends on what you mean with "producer" and "consumer".

To the GPIO subsystem atleast a "consumer" is a device
grabbing a GPIO, like SMSC911x WLAN chip or something.

The producer name here is something like the name of the
rail. (I would even consider using "gpio-rail-names" for this
property...)

If the GPIO controls an LDO regulator, then the rail will be
named something like "ldo3" indeed.

We need to distinguish the producer name from e.g. the
name of the pin on the package, as that is by nature
ambigous and likely to have a name such as "gpio3".

It would still be a different property?

Having a symbolic GPIO line/rail name across several board
with different chipsets is the explicit goal for people like
96boards and IoT libraries they use. (Put them on CC).

Let me respin the patch and we keep talking.
