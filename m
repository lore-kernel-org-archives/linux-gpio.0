Patch applied tentatively so we have some maintenance entry for this.

Andreas expressed concerns about the driver earlier, so he might want it
split from the platform parts and have a separate entry for the pinctrl+GPIO
so Manivannan can maintain that part, also it makes sense to list
Manivannan as comaintainer of ARCH_ACTIONS with this in.

Andreas: how would you like to proceed?

I understand that I was a bit pushy or even rude in my last message
about the maintenance of this platform and the code structure of
the pin control driver. I am sorry if it caused any bad feelings on your
side :( social conflicts give me the creeps, I just try my best. Maybe
my best isn't always what it should be.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
