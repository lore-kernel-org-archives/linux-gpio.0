I fixed this up when applying. It is corect, it should always be IRQ_TYPE_NONE
unless it is a very old driver using boardfiles. The proper type is set up
when the driver using it requests the IRQ.

Some drivers also need to set the default handler to handle_bad_irq
and then also set that up in the irqchip .set_type() callback, especially
those hardwares that have an ACK register for edge IRQs so that a second
edge irq can come in when handling a first edge IRQ. Level IRQs don't
have this problem for obvious reasons, so we need to select between
handle_edge_irq() or handle_level_irq() on these hardwares.

Could you or Neil or both check if this applies to sx150x?

Thanks a lot Andrey!
