I thought a bit more about this and the changes that would be necessary
to achieve this:

 - introduce new flags IS_FIXED_DIR and IS_FIXED_VALUE for struct
   gpio_desc::flags and error out accordingly in gpiod_set_direction_*
   and gpiod_set_value respectively. Then we have:

   	- already existing hogs: IS_FIXED_DIR | IS_FIXED_VALUE
	- a) IS_FIXED_DIR
	- b)+c) 0
	- d) (if desired) IS_FIXED_VALUE
 
   d) might need additional bookkeeping to remember the configured value
   when the direction is changed to input.
   These flags must be passed to gpiod_hog, via lflags should work.

 - don't auto-request hogged pins
   Currently hogged pins are not available for consumers to be
   requested. This needs to be changed at least for the three (or four)
   new cases.
   IMHO it is sensible to allow requesting a gpio that is completely
   hogged and just prevent changing direction and (if it's an output)
   value.
   TODO: review places that use IS_REQUESTED for need of adaption
   TODO: race between hog and consumer?

 - teach of_parse_own_gpio about IS_FIXED_DIR and IS_FIXED_VALUE

 - expand gpiolib_dbg_show to show IS_FIXED_DIR and IS_FIXED_VALUE

@Linus: I'd like to have an ok from your side that you like the approach
before working on implementing this. So it would be great if you shared
your thoughts about my ideas.

Best regards
Uwe
