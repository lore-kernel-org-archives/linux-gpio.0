It is not clear to me how this could happen - core powering down
devices when it should not, unless pins are shared.  And if I am not
missing something, pinctrl is designed to handle this case by only by
switching to idle/suspend/default states from the controller drivers
in the suspend/resume routine. ACPI _Sx calls also happens at the same
time so there does not seem to be a contention point.

Perhaps I am missing something and an example of such issue would make
it more clear.

And, as our primary use case is to set the initial muxing, we can
easily remove the suspend/resume functionality if this turns out to be
the issue.

IMO having an ASWG pinctrl specification and using _DSD for Linux are
orthogonal approaches. The latter is very specific to Linux and we
want it so that we can support the Linux pinctrl model as best as
possible and I doubt it is a common denominator for all OSes that ACPI
supports.
