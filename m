It might be interpreted that all platform data from all the drivers
should gone. While ideal case should be like this and I totally agree
with you, we are living in non-ideal world, that's why we used to and
continue using some ID-based quirks (PCI enumeration, I2C enumeration,
ACPI enumeration, SPI enumeration, UART enumeration, an so on, so on).

Moreover ACPI comes into ARM(64) world which might have its own troubles
with generating correct tables and we might end up with quirks there.

So, I disagree that here is possible to hide like you said "all such
stuff in ...platform_crap.c".

If the certain driver cares about ACPI enumerated devices it might care
about supporting it disregarding on how new firmware is used (supporting
_DSD or not).
