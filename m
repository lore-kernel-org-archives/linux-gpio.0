I dont think we need to support the individual gpio to be enable/disable 
by status.
We need to support the status property at node level only. if individual 
gpio need to be enabled/disabled by status then it need to break in 
different hog nodes.

This is same as like we have in pincontrol where we can provide the list 
of pin names for some configuration under same node.

Yaah, lables for plural only. Otherwise no issue with "label".
