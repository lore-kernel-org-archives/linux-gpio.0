Well, in this case the motivation would be to make it possible to live
without platform data with these drivers, but in the end the situation
would be exactly the same. We need to give a gpio descriptor to
some other device in a driver. So the goal would be that in the actual
consumer driver of the gpio we could request it always in one way,
ideally always with gpiod_get() call.

But if there is no real need in other places for this thing, then
let's forget about it.
