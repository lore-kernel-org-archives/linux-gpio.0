Hi,

I saw this patch as it came in through Dinh's pull request, see below:

This is an odd setup. We usually would have it all in one node, since
the @ff708000 is the GPIO controller, instead of adding a subnode with
the actual GPIO info.

So I would have expected something more like:


gpio0: gpio-controller@ff708000 {
                       #address-cells =3D <1>;
                       #size-cells =3D <0>;
                       compatible =3D "snps,dw-apb-gpio";
                       reg =3D <0xff708000 0x1000>;
                       interrupts =3D <0 164 4>;
                      clocks =3D <&per_base_clk>;
                       status =3D "disabled";
                       gpio-controller;
                       #gpio-cells =3D <2>;
                       snps,nr-gpios =3D <29>;
                       interrupt-controller;
                       #interrupt-cells =3D <2>;
               };


=2E.. or is there some underlying reason for having the two-layer
approach that isn't obvious from this device tree?
