I think I kind of get it.

This reminds me of recent patches to the generic GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP
where we made it possible to "mask" set of IRQ lines, saying
"these are in the irqdomain, but you cannot map them".

See
commit 79b804cb6af4f128b2c53f0887c02537a7eb5824
"gpiolib: Make it possible to exclude GPIOs from IRQ domain"
commit 96b2cca64fa3e1a31b573bb308b2944c802aacf3
"gpio: stmpe: forbid unused lines to be mapped as IRQs"

So what we do in the generic case is put a linear map over all
the lines/offsets, then punch holes in that map and say
"this and this and this can not be mapped as IRQ".

As you can see in _gpiochip_irqchip_add() we pre-map all
except those with irq_create_mapping().

Does this scheme fit with your usecase? I would guess so,
just that your domain is hierarchic, not simple/linear.

Maybe the takeaway is that your map does not need to
be "dense", i.e. every hwirq is in use. It can be sparse.
It is stored in a radix tree anyways.

It's OK to use the offset vs hwirq.

I just misunderstand it as the global GPIO number, that is
not OK.
