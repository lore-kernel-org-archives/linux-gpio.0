Seems like this is pretty much finished.

Let's see if you can collect some ACKs before we apply it.

Now just minor things remain.

Random chosen example:

People (e.g. Torvalds) sometimes get upset with files with too many lines
in them. This file has a lot of lines. A lot of pin control drivers try to cut
down the lines with macros, and you do it in some places too,
would you consider to see if you can cut down these tables with
macros?

S900_PADS(LVDS_EEP, LVDS_EEN, LVDS_EDP, LVDS_EDN,
                    LVDS_ECP, LVDS_ECN, LVDS_EBP, LVDS_EBN);
S900_PADS(SD0_D3, SD0_D2, SD0_D1, SD0_D0);

Would be so much more compact.

It's not the biggest problem though.
