At least to me, this:

+       i2c {
+               compatible = "i2c-gpio";
+               gpios = <&gio 0xD 5 0>, <&gio 0xD 6 0>;
+               i2c-gpio,delay-us = <2>;

which immediately shows that it's port D pins 5 and 6 which are being used, and
which matches the naming in the schematics and the chip documentation is
clearly preferable to this:

+               gpios = <&gio 101 0>, <&gio 102 0>;

which uses made up numbers with no relation to any documentation and which
probably requires the use of a calculator to determine if the correct
pins are being used.

(btw, the ports have varying numbers of GPIOs and none of them have 32).

Yes, but I did it the way I did for the reasons below.

The binding in the patch matches the hardware.  The hardware is
described as one IP with several ports and not several instances of the
same IP.  The registers are also just 3 per port in the same region.
Creating one instance of the device for handling each port, seems
like useless overhead at best and, because it doesn't even match how the
hardware looks like, quite wrong anyway.

Only port A has interrupt support; this is not implemented in the
current driver.

BTW, the documentation for the chip is available here (GIO starts at
page 647 and its registers at page 895):

Why?  These are just offsets to the base address so there's no reason
they _have_ to be 32 bits so u32 seems semantically wrong.

OK.
