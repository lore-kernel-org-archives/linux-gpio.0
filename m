Correct. There are few reasons:
1. Platform was never designed as ACPI
2. Platform is EOL.
3. We tried, we pulled some strings, no ID.

See above. Partially I can agree with you, but technically speaking the
platform wasn't designed to be ACPI.

I dunno. Mika, do you know anyone else we may ask about?

I agree, so, I exclude it in new version.

Though, no one prevents to use it in DT environment. We chose to bring
ACPI support to that platform.

Are you implying we should chose DT over ACPI?

Should it have anything else? Perhaps register base and length? Sure, I
will add them.

Believe me, we also try to do the right things right, though there is an
obstacle we can't jump over as easily as in DT world.
