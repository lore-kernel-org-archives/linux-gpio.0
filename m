Makes sense, I'll push the patch once the rest of this driver gets
pulled in-case more changes are needed.

But which of_node?

regulator_config->of_node
regulator_config->dev->of_node

The second is the only one I see getting used, the first is only
used when drivers provide their own init_data and automatic init
data getting fails.

The same issue is present in GPIO (gpiolib.c:612), where the of_node
in the config takes precedence over the one in config->dev, the
opposite is true for regulators, this is very confusing and should be
standardized.
