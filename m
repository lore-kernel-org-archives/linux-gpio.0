The BSP (Melis and Linux). (e.g. "libs/suniv" directory of the Melis SDK an=
d=20
"arch/arm/boot/dts/sunivw1p1.dtsi" in the Linux SDK)

Okay. I will choose to use f1c100s in my next patchset, as it's where
it's developed. (Although I mainly refered F1C600 BSP and document)

So the suniv-f1c100s.dtsi will still be kept empty and all peripherals know=
n=20
should go through suniv.dtsi.
