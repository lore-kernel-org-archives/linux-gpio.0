OK.

Here you mixed up the things. Either we are talking about GPIO
configuration (direction, enabling/disabling I/O buffers), or we are
talking about pin configuration (bias, drive strength, slew rate,
debounce, etc.).

Which is still wrong and nothing prevents us to just stop here and
consider better way.

The issue is how we historically represent pins inside kernel and how
hardware evolves at the same time.

Looking from now retrospectively I can state the following:
- each GPIO controller *might* have (few) capabilities of pin configuration
- pin control may not necessary have GPIO function of the pin

Design is now GPIO oriented while it should be pin oriented.

So, instead of littering GPIO API, would we consider to redesign a bit
from the above point of view?

(Read ahead: to be backward compatible and be more friendly for simple
GPIO IPs it would make sense to leave some of the basic pin properties
to be controlled from GPIO API, otherwise forget completely about GPIO
driver, and think of pin control driver for new complex IPs)

[pin]: might have attached set of functions, set of [electrical] properties.
It might be re-configured run time in terms of function and configuration.
It might have none, one, or more owners (this is already an OS abstraction)

Thus, the core function is pin request, while GPIO request is just a
particular case.
Owner of the pin is defined independently on what function or
configuration is chosen.

Therefore, we will have something like this (permissions):
- none (no one can do anything, except acquiring an ownership == requesting pin)
- exclusive (only one user allowed to cover all properties of the pin)
- shared (several owners can do modify all or selected properties)
- shared for all (anyone can do anything, perhaps we don't need this)

This is similar to what I called before as "shared" ownership. To be
precise, transformation "exclusive" to "shared".

Please, no artificial states here. It brings more issues than solves.
Deterministic is:
- pin electrical properties
- current (active) function
- current (active) owner(s)

Whatever currently means "states" they are defined per owner basis.

Reserve how? In DT?

Yes, valid point.

Correct, or any other function.

What we need is pin_request_function() API and pin_set_config(). GPIO
is kinda legacy (in terns of configuring and controlling pins).

So, consider my idea above about ownership. It would give you less
pain how to proceed with pins. In DT or ACPI we may supply a property
to tell OS how ownership has to be handled:
strict (or "exclusive", one owner for pin properties), "shared", or
"none" (not requested, first come, first served)

Yes, pin function might need a special type of owners to do power
management, for example, but in above scheme it would be just a
subtype of "shared" (okay, "strict" in that way also would "shared"
but only for PM core).
