What client exactly? Between the dtb and kernel or kernel and userspace 
or ...?

You generally don't want bindings to evolve.

Then you might want to split these into 2 regions. The problem is 
request_resource does not work with overlapping resources. Or just don't 
do subnodes. If there is not a lot of variations in the subnode data, 
then just leave that information in the kernel.
