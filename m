I don't see this, the alternative is matching to this "regulator-compatible",
why not just use the existing compatible.

Could you expand this? I'm not sure I understand why we still cant do this
using this new way.

Bindings should have compatible strings when they describe hardware like this,
we can then do stuff like put the LDO and DCDC drivers in separate modules for
instance, letting DT only load what we need. There are other benefits like
not having to search our own DT binding for data, and we only get probed for
devices in the DT.

This also eliminates the need for MFD_CORE, we just call
of_platform_populate on ourself and DT helpers do the rest. Why hard code
mfd_cell's and do matching when DT does the same thing.

The binding is the same as the new tps65218 driver, different isn't always
a warning sign. And what do you mean "requires more code"? This regulator
driver is smaller than almost any other. DT takes care of everything for
us relating to hardware instantiation like it should.
