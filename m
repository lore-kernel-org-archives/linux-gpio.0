Thanks for a patch with such nice description.
I have couple of nitpicks and one question below.

I would rather spell "IRQ handlers"

Can we leave above condition and put here just

	acpi_gpiochip_request_irqs(acpi_gpio);

?

I don't remember if I asked already about possible memory leak here.
Am I reading code right?

Reading more code, I'm even not sure if this condition could ever happen.
