Thanks for looking at the series.

Yes I understand where your coming from. And that's exactly what I
was trying to do in v2. I have 2 of these devices with open drain output
that is feed to an inverter. So active low output from devices and irq
consumer is active high input.

However Linux wasn't a fan of the property and wanted it gone.
He suggested we need a "inverter" device to allow for that in the
device tree. I haven't got my head around how to do that thou.

And if someone is relying on that implicit behaviour are we allowed
to break things? Probably ok with this one as it's currently not possible
due to code patch 1 removes.

If we need to model the invert to get the patches accepted I look into that.
I don't actually need it for my system as I can set open-drain with overrides
the active-high control on this device, while have active high irq consumer.
:)
