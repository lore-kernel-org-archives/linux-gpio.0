Well so is the IRQ number, but we still put that in the device tree.

It's a grayzone. People use ranges in the device tree for example when
there are several instances of the same GPIO block with different
ranges into a single pin controller and then it makes sense.

But in this case you have your separate chip with one instance so
it doesn't make sense, keep it like this.

Also it is necessary to proble from boardfiles as you explained in the
pinctrl patch.

Good job, it's a nice driver. Also the pinctrl driver is very nice.
