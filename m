What is this? Does it come from some other existing binding?
I was feeling native endian is the default unless LE or BE is
explicitly specified...

I don't like this and don't understand why you can't just cover
all GPIO registers with a single reg property.

Reference the standard bindings in gpio.txt for cells and controller.

That is weird. Explain why this is needed.

Also I do not understand this at all. Why pick out two 16bit registers?
Surely the rest of the registers at 0xfffe0400 must be GPIO registers
as well? Are they not?

If they are, cover them all with a single reg property.

If they are not all GPIO registers, use MFD syscon for this and access
the constituent parts through that.
