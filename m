Hello,

This series exposes a "reset tolerant" property for GPIOs. For example, the
controller implemented in Aspeed BMCs provides such a feature to allow the BMC
to be reset whilst maintaining necessary state to keep host systems alive or
status LEDs in-tact.

I'm sending it as an RFC because I'm not sure using pinconf is the right way
to go about it, or that expanding the sysfs interface is a good idea, or that
the approach taken is right in the context of the existing suspend support.
pinconf just ended up being a convenient abstraction whilst supporting the
sysfs change, and didn't feel unreasonable to use for devicetree or the chardev
interface either. My concern with using pinconf is that the reset-tolerant
property is (currently) GPIO-centric, but maybe that's not a worry.

So the patches in the series support configuring the property via devicetree,
the chardev interface and the sysfs interface. The sysfs interface also exposes
the ability to configure the suspend tolerance, though there are some ordering
requirements with respect to setting the direction (the suspend tolerance will
only take if configured before setting the pin direction on the Arizona
controller).

Please review!

Cheers,

Andrew
