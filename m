Version 2:
  Fixed up Maxime's review comments
    - Reduce size of char array
    - Use snprintf()
  Applied Maxime's Acks 

ST's hardware differentiates between GPIO mode and Pinctrl alternate
functions.  When a pin is in GPIO mode, there are dedicated registers
to set and obtain direction status.  However, If a pin's alternate
function is in use then the direction is set and status is derived
from a bunch of syscon registers.  The issue is; until now there was
a lack of parity between the two.

Lee Jones (5):
  pinctrl: st: Introduce a 'get pin function' call
  pinctrl: st: Move st_get_pio_control() further up the source file
  pinctrl: st: Supply a GPIO get_direction() call-back
  pinctrl: st: Show correct pin direction -- even when in GPIO mode
  pinctrl: st: Display pin's function when printing pinctrl debug
    information
