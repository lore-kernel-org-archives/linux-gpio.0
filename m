Hi Mark,

Thanks for the clarification and for pointing out other frameworks to 
look at.

Yes, I think the iio may be a good place but I'll need to investigate 
where it should go. I'm not sure it fits into the adc subdirectory. I 
see similar functionality in the MAX1363 part but it's not actually an 
ADC - it only has the supervisor compare functionality.

Thank you!
