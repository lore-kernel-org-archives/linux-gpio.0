That is the assumption made by the core. Until the day someone
comes up with a weird usecase...

Multiple consumers is the term we would use. But yes.

Sounds reasonable.

Logical conclusion from the above yes.

So I think what I need to see is a proposed patch, whether it will
hit a particular driver or the gpiolib core, but either would probably
be interesting.

Pls keep linux-gpio and Alexandre on CC for this discussion.
