This patch must be CC to devicetree@vger.kernel.org as it concerns
device tree bindings. Please also keep Alexandre Courbot in the loop as
he's working on GPIO refactorings.

This is a very terse commit message for something which will have
a very drastic impact on the Linux kernel and device tree.

What does this mean? You have to define all terms. And also consider the
audience. If someone is using device tree on Symbian or Windows,
what does "export" mean to them? Not all readers of this document
are Linux implementers.

If this is a Linux-specific concept it should be named "linux-gpio-export"

But overall I'm not happy with this *at all* as the sysfs ABI is already
enough of a trouble for us. WIth platforms switching to DT-only
probing it would be perfect to get rid of this sysfs interface altogether.

Two questions:

- What do you think of the approach of just not using this for DT
  boots, instead we create a new userspace ABI, using e.g. a
  char device for each GPIO chip like /dev/gpio0, /dev/gpio1 etc
  and access these using ioctl:s?

- I guess you have a specific system in mind for this? What is the
  use case? I have seen *way* too many people trying to reimplement
  drivers/leds/leds-gpio.c
  drivers/input/keyboard/gpio_keys.c
  drivers/input/keyboard/gpio_keys_polled.c
  drivers/power/gpio-charger.c
  drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-gpio.c
  drivers/extcon/extcon-gpio.c
  drivers/spi/spi-gpio.c
  IN USERSPACE! JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN!

>From a kernel developers point of view the kernel shall handle
hardware, so that is why I'm quite picky about this.
