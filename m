On a second thought I am no longer sure if that is the right approach.

A gpio is for input and output of =930=94 and =931=94 values. And a gpi=
o consumer
can control if the output should be active or inactive and input.

How the output is physically represented (totem-pole or single-ended,
high power, low power etc.) is not a property of the gpio itself and
there is IMHO no need for the consumer to be able to define (or change)
it.

On SoC with integrated gpio controllers it is very common to have
pinmux definitions completely separated from the gpio controller
properties. But the gpio consumer can connect to pinctrl settings
to describe that the pin should have certain physical properties.

There, it is common to be able to enable/disable pull-up/downs as
well.

So turning a totem-pole output (as it is available in the tca6424)
into an open-drain output is sort of turning off the pull-up transistor=
=2E
I.e. comparable to a pinmux setting.

So such controllers should get the option to define pinctrl.

Some chips might have special control registers for doing that
while others need the trick to switch between input and output
mode but that is driver implementation detail.

But I am not sure if this has other implications.
