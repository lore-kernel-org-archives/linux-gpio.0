But that's exactly what abx500_gpio_probe() in pinctrl-abx500.c does. 
Here's even a reference to holes in the GPIO space:

/*
  * Compute number of GPIOs from the last SoC gpio range descriptors
  * These ranges may include "holes" but the GPIO number space shall
  * still be homogeneous, so we need to detect and account for any
  * such holes so that these are included in the number of GPIO pins.

So you want to change "gpio_chip" to add an "available" callback?  And 
every time gpiolib wants to call a gpio_chip callback, it should call 
->available first?  Like this:

if (chip->available && chip->available())
	status = chip->direction_input(chip, gpio_chip_hwgpio(desc));

I can do that, but it just seems very redundant.  The core already knows 
not to touch GPIOs that are not in a pin range.  The only exception is 
gpiochip_add_data(), as I've stated before.

It just seems wrong to call an API every time to ask permission before 
we can call any other API.  But since the API may not be defined, we 
have to first check if the API exists before we can ask permission.
