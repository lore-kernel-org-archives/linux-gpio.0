Why don't we start with checking for similar cases during review, like
I'm now doing for only a week or two?

I think they're confusing at best. Ie, when reading the code and the
corresponding Kconfig file one has to wonder: should the Kconfig symbol
actually be tristate or should it stay bool but did someone forget to
delete the module-specific code?

They're useful, mostly, for module utilities. Outside that scope they
add information that thousands of files (that can also only be built-in
but do not have these macros) do not have and, apparently, do not need.

Thanks,
