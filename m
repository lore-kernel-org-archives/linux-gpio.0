Do you avoid this problem on new ACPI tables because only pins
that are able to be read are exposed?

If it's in gpiochip_add_pin_range() would we still read the
hardware when creating the pin ranges? I don't want to have to
describe pin ranges of "valid" pins that won't cause the system
to blow up if we touch them, because those pins are never used by
Linux so reading them is not useful.
