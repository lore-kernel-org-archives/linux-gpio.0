I think perhaps the problem here is that because we group these all as
"arizona" and the tables look similar, there's an assumption that they
all share most of a core set of registers which we could factor out and
be left with only a few trivial differences between chips. Actually
the arizona platform is just a collection of IP blocks from which devic=
es
can be built, any device can contain any selection of these blocks.
There's blocks that appear on most devices but nothing that could be
called "core" set - even the shared blocks are actually slightly
different across the different chips that use them. Also the address
map is sparse to allow IP blocks to grow, or have different groups of
registers on different chips, without having to move its address around=
,
which is why ranges won't reduce the code size much.

There's a lot of similarity between the tables but also lots of
differences. If we moved it to a header file it just means we move 8000=
+
lines from .c to .h and then the .c #includes them all back again.

In the end, these big files aren't aesthetically pleasing, but ease
of maintenance is important and they aren't total duplicates.
