AFAIK pinctrl binding happens before probe time, and is tied to the
DT. Each driver requesting pins would have to have a separate node.
Seems like there isn't one for the regulators.

Or we'd have to manually configure them for each regulator that needs
them, and list the relevant pinctrl properties under its own node.
One "on" and "off" setting pair for each LDO_IO regulator. We could
then tie the settings to the regulator device, not the underlying
mfd sub-device.
