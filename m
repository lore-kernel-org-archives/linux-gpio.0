Hats of for this series.

It's just a very genuinely well done piece of engineering.

For all of the patches.

Once the IRQ portions are fine with the maintainers:

If Marc/Greg want to merge all of it (including the GPIO driver)
I'm happy for them to do so with my ACK.

Else I can take an immutable branch from the IRQ tree into the
GPIO tree, or merge all the patches to the GPIO tree with their
ACKs (if they feel safe about that).

Yours,
Linus Walleij
