I'm getting ready to update my series with a patch like that. I would
like to consolidate the gpio drivers into a single file. But for the
v4 series at least the parsers are still residing in their original files
(I hoped this would make the transition from the _probe to the parser
less painless but the diff came out pretty much unreadable). 
I think this would be just a matter of what's preferred.
