Because at the time I started writing these drivers it was still
exclusive for ARCH_BCM, will move them there.

This isn't a user selectable symbol so I don't see the need for that.

I plan to use it on both mips/bcm63xx (no dts support) and bmips (dts
support), so yes.

See above.

I did consider it, but it makes the !OF case more complicated, and the
current of_gpio base code requires changing for it.

That's because some of the pinctrl chips need to set the
gpio-direction for muxes, and for that need to have a reference to the
gpio-controller(s). Since any muxes directly tied to the controller
node will get applied as soon as the controller is registered, it
needs to aquire the gpio-controller references first.

On the gpio-controller side, to flag these a requiring pinctrl those
would then have a gpio-range property, which will cause the probe
being deferred until the reference to the controller can be resolved.
Which waits for the gpio-controller to be registered, so it can
resolve its references to it. A true catch 22 ;-)

This could probably resolved by deferring resolving node-to-pincontrol
devices to gpio request time. Not sure if this then would conflict
which gpio-hogs on such a gpio-controller node?

I haven't really thought how much work it would be for the !OF case,
but would probably mean I need to acquire references based on their
pdev names.

The most obvious would be having a gpio-ranges property, but this
leads to issues mentioned above. And only works for OF.
