Using ngpios to restrict the amount of actually available GPIOs from
the possible amount of GPIOs seems a rather limited use, as rerouted
gpios are seldom at the end of the GPIO space.

So maybe it makes more sense to use ngpio as the number of
possible gpios and then have an additional "reserved-gpios"
bitmask / list of unavailable gpios?

Ideally those would be just consumed by a pinctrl instance, but I
guess that these are sometimes controlled through pinstrapping,
so there might be no driver to attach to them.
