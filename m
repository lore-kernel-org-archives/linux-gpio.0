This seems like a completely generic driver, rather than some oddball
hack, so I'd prefer to not see it in drivers/misc at all. Maybe you
can find some other maintainer who is willing to put it into his
subsystem, candidates would be

 * gpio
 * irqchip
 * power
 * of/dt

I don't see anything wrong with the basic approach though.

I haven't followed that discussion, but it's good to hear that
you made some progress there. I find it a bit worrying that you
say the behavior may be dependent on the gpio driver, but maybe
I didn't fully understand what the resolution is.

Right.
