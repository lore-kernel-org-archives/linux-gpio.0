Let=E2=80=99s put that in a pseudo DT definition.

BANK_A: bank_a {
	compatible =3D =E2=80=9Cbanka,gpio-controller=E2=80=9D;
};

GPIO_REGULATOR: gpio-regulator {
	compatible =3D =E2=80=9Cgpio-regulator=E2=80=9D;
	gpio =3D <&BANK_A 14>;
};

BANK_B: bank_b {
	compatible =3D =E2=80=9Cbankb,gpio-controller=E2=80=9D;
	power-supply =3D <&GPIO_REGULATOR>;
};

The correct probe order is bank_a, gpio-regulator, bank_b correct?

It is possible to modify DTC to follow phandle references and spit out
a depends node that the platform bus probe can use.

=46or instance,=20

	__depends__ {
		gpio-regulator =3D <&BANK_A>;
		bank_b =3D <&GPIO_REGULATOR>;
	};

Would that work for your case?
