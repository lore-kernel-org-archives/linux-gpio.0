Are you annoyed with me?

In that case please take it down a bit, I understand it can
be stressful as developer, but I need to maintain the stuff
we're pushing in for years to come and it's my job to
ask the tricksy questions.

That depends. If you're a hobbyist with limited access to
documentation I agree. In that case let's go for something
that floats your project, I'm fine with that. I have a weak spot
for people with a good project and limited resources, so I
am here to help. I'd say then let's go for some "nxp,foo" property.

If you are working for NXP directly or under contract, what you say
is that the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing and that
is never a good sign. Such as the hardware and software departments
do not talk to each other, do not have each other mail addresses
and practice what is called "throw over the wall-engineering".
Or throw it all the way over to Pengutronix, maybe, a separate
legal entity they don't even prioritize to inform. What do I know.

In this latter case it is more or less my responsibility as subsystem
maintainer to push back at NXP as a legal body, it has nothing to
do with the people involved. Especially not you personally. In this
case I am adressing your organization, not you.

So which one is it?

+- drive-strength               Integer: controls Drive Strength
+                                       0: driver disabled
+                                       1: 255 Ohm
+                                       2: 105 Ohm
+                                       3:  75 Ohm
+                                       4:  85 Ohm
+                                       5:  65 Ohm
+                                       6:  45 Ohm
+                                       7:  40 Ohm

As for equal resistances R = Rx/N assuming it is
really 255 Ohms internal resistance per totempole:

1: 255
2: 127,5
3: 85
4: 63,75
5: 51
6: 42,5
7: 36,4

I don't know. Something is not right. Maybe this is how
CMOS work under load?

I guess that is what other datasheets have been listing.
I have personally seen a few of those.

I don't know if it is as simple as a totem-pole, I guess
IIRC under ideal circumstances the internal resistance of an
operational amplifier is zero. E.g. on a popular TTL part uA 741
it is 5.5 milliohms. What is Rout for a normal CMOS totem-pole?
Some googling suggests ~400 Ohm so 255 Ohm may not be
so far off.

Does anyone else know?

This is pretty interesting stuff :D

This sounds like a perfect argument to create a new
property "output-impedance" and use that in my ears.
It makes more sense to a designer, because what they
really want to do, electrically, is to match impedances.

I am thinking some designer writing this device tree.
What they want to control is the output impedance, not
drive strength. So that name makes more sense.

Yes it seems like a good idea, if (by your own line of reasoning)
it is the physical principle underlying these resistance settings.
Then we are likely to see it again.

Since we are already (obviously) confused, we have to choose
the lesser evil here.

Apparently what (board- system-) designers want to do is match
output resistance to load, I would argue that it is more confusing
to call that "drive strength", i.e. what is misleading is not what I am
discussing here, but the manual you are referring to. Just a bad
piece of technical writing.

Can we talk to them about this?

I don't like to think about them as some foreign people in a far
away dimension we can never understand or communicate
with, how do they really do what they do?

I was hoping we could dig in a bit and figure out what we
are going to do and why and how these people think.

I want to avoid poking magic values we don't really understand
into registers and using the manual as alchemic magic or
spellbook, essentially. (As so often happens...)

If you want something to match the specific hardware
manual from NXP and you don't want it to be translated
into the units of the DT binding, then I think it is better
to use something prefixed "nxp,*".

That clearly indicates that this is some NXP oddity that
we don't really understand.

I was just hoping not to introduce too many of these.
