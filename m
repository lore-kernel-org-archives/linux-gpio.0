The feedback is the same: let's consider that after getting the basics
reviewed, accepted and merged.

Yuck, but better than no support for both _BOTH I guess.

But again, discussion of hacks for the hardware limitation is getting in
the way discussing and merging the basics.  Let's get the basics right
first, then add functionality.  

I understand it can be rather frustrating to give up features and/or
functionality for having something "clean", but unfortunately, that's
how the upstream linux kernel community has always worked.

Most maintainers prefer clean, well-designed and maintainable code that
comes in small, easily reviewable chunks over something that's difficult
to understand with hacks and workarounds.  Even if that means a limited
feature set initially.

Additional functionality (even if hacky) is much easier to review,
discuss and maintain *later* when it's on top of a starting point that
is clean.
