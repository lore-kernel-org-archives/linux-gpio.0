The problem here is to declare a right consumer of the resource.

My understanding that consumer at the end is device or device(s):

none: resource is free to acquire
exclusive: certain device has access to the resource (pin)
shared: several devices may access to the resource

In both cases couple of caveats:
- power management has a special access level to the resource on
behalf of the owner(s)
- it can have some flags, like 'locked', which means no more owners
can be changed / added, but still possible to free resource by all
owners to go to state 'none'

Yes, since the ownership design is based on subsystem rather consumer device.

See above, hope it clarifies a bit.
