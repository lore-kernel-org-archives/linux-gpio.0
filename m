We need to revive that. I do plan to discuss this with Linus F2F next 
week.

No issues with adding this information. The question is just how should 
all this fit together (line names, simple functions (e.g. switches), and 
initialization). The overall structure needs to extendable. As Linus 
said, we need a proposal that addresses all these issues.

That doesn't mean we can't decide some bindings were a bad idea and move 
towards something new.

Frequently that may be right. However, I think having a temporary 
binding only encourages to not fully define their h/w. Think of the case 
where you have a single DTB and support multiple OSs (or different 
versions). The DTB would have to work with both as one OS may require 
gpio-hogs and the other may require a specific driver. That should be 
possible to do. Requiring removing the gpio-hog to add a specific 
binding is a problem. AIUI, a hog will prevent any other user in the 
kernel. I think that is backwards in that a hog should only provide some 
default configuration/use.
