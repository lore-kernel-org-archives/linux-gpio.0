When requesting regular muxing from function pinmux_enable_setting(),
pin_request() is invoked with gpio_range = NULL. But, when requesting
GPIO, function pinmux_request_gpio() always passes a valid range. So,
if gpio_owner is set, it is correct to fail a request either the
request is for this GPIO or the request is for regular muxing of this
GPIO pin and the strict bit is set.

Why this is wrong? If gpio_range != NULL, the request of a GPIO is
already checked in the first if clause.

In strict case:
Both mux_owner and gpio_owner are checked no matter whether GPIO or
regular muxing is requested.
If both checking pass, muxing_owner or gpio_owner is set according to
the request type.

In non strict case:
Request of GPIO is checked in the first if clause against gpio_owner,
while request of regular muxing is checked in the second if clause
against mux_owner.
If either checking passes, its owner is set which doesn't affect the
checking of the other request type.

Anyway, if you think doing the explicit check in both if() and else()
clauses is better, I am fine to send a new patch.

OK
