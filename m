If I could only understand it.

Don't you actually want to go and read a few registers on another
IO range?

What we generally do when pin control is spread out in a system is try
to consolidate it, meaning expose the necessary registers on the remote
end using syscon (drivers/mfd/syscon) so that we can easily get a handle
on these registers withe regmap MMIO.

Since regmap handles atomic access to the registers, that way we
protect from disasters and keep the state in the hardware.

I don't know if this is helpful. For a normal peripheral you may not want
to put a regmap over all its registers but you prefer to ioremap it, and then
we get the spaghetti of accessor functions to peek and poke into another
peripherals I/O space, and that is undesireable.

Maybe this is completely not understanding what you want to do, so
sorry, please elaborate. I am afraid the two of you are the only people on
the planet who actually understand what is going on here.

Also the hardware engineer who wrote the Aspeed pin controller, I would
like to read this persons design specification, I am pretty sure it is very
interesting.

That seems like unnecessary shoehorning. Is it reflecting the register layout
of the hardware or are you trying to save bits? For the latter, let it
go and instead
have one member for offset and one member for selector.
