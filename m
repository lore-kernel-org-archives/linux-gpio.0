The latter. The IPQ40xx have one LED controller @ 0x1937000. 
According to the driver (leds-ipq40xx.c in the SDK), it 
does control up to 11 LEDs. A LED can either be muxed to
one of the hardware sources (wifi, lan or wan-ports activity/linkspeed),
or it can be operated by one of four software-programmable "blink"
sources (each with a variable blink rate and duty cycle). 
The driver labels each LED as "ipq40xx::led%d".

That said: ASUS, Cisco, Compex, Netgear, Zyxel... opted to either
1. export the individual GPIOs with sysfs
2. gpio-leds

Ok. Can I leave wifi1_cal, _wci, uartX... the way they are?

Ok, I'll wait for how qca8074 plays out then.
By the way, can you ask if the QCA8074 follows the IPQ40XX SoC's
GPIO Pull-up config?

I'm asking because Varadarajan was also involved in the
pinctrl-ipq4019 back in 2015: <https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/7662241/>

Back then, this wasn't mentioned anywhere. In fact, the special pull-up
configuration was only discovered due to an issue with the NAND on the
Cisco Meraki MR33. So I think it is better ask them now, when the devs
are actually present/responding.

Ok.

Sadly no. That said, neither the u-boot nor the linux kernel
sources set any pin to bootX. I think I'll remove it for now.

Yes, this is very likely. We know that this is the case for the qpic_padX.
