This should be conditioned on being able to divide up the registers by
bank which seems like you can't. Or there's the case like the DW GPIO
block and the number of banks is configurable.

I'm not sure offhand. There are lots of examples of single nodes I'm
sure. Which ones have banks I haven't a clue. IIRC, there were some
cases where the bank # was part of the GPIO cells, but I seem to
recall Linus prefers not having 3 cells.
