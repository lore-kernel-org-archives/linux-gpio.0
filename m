I mean val vs value, yes.

Sure, but if we use that we could also just not make any change to the
code except for changing the type of the argument when that's needed.

Hrm, right.  I suppose it's more useful than checkpatch cleanups.  In
any case I'm not sure it's relevant here where we're reading a value?

I have to say I'm not sure I'm finding this is actually adding to the
clarity - it was partly a cheap trick for compiler implementation but
the int as boolean thing C has does also make this sort of code for
mapping values onto bitfields more direct which is handy for low level
systems programming like drivers.
