Not quite. You can still determine the gpio number in the above cases by
walking the sysfs tree to find the chip and it's base. This is the only
way to do this for dynamic buses such as USB.

The only case for which this fails is if a pin function is moved (e.g.
your i2c-expander case above).

Indeed. The current sysfs-interface is a hack (which I personally think
never should have been merged).

Firmware should describe pin directionality and function, and undefined
pins should never be allowed to be accessed from userspace.

Sure, the current GPIO-sysfs-interface is useful during development and
for one-off hacks, but I'm convinced it's detrimental in the long run as
it removes the incentives to fix the driver code that it's used to work
around (e.g. custom init script to toggle enable lines of some radio
chips).

As Rob already mentioned, what we want is some way to declare pin
functions. These could then be requested from userspace (or used in DT,
something which should allow for further refactoring there as well)
unless a driver has already claimed them.

We don't want to add more dependencies on the current sysfs-based
interface, which I hope we'll one day will be able to retire in favour
of a more sane one.
