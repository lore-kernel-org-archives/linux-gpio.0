Well, while decoupling single-endedness from polarity was the right
thing to do, this change did actually break the DT binary interface.

If you have an old compiled dtb whose source used GPIO_OPEN_DRAIN, you
now instead get *open-source* behaviour on 4.12:

	GPIO_OPEN_DRAIN = GPIO_SINGLE_ENDED | GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW
	
		=> active-low, but *open source*

while if you recompile that source against 4.12 you do get the expected
open-drain behaviour, but now with inverted polarity:

	GPIO_OPEN_DRAIN = GPIO_SINGLE_ENDED | GPIO_LINE_OPEN_DRAIN
	
		=> open drain, but *active high*

requiring the device tree to be updated by specifying

	(GPIO_OPEN_DRAIN | GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW)

I guess the latter is fine, even if it is likely to amount to a fair bit
of debugging world wide.

Perhaps all this can still be avoided by adding further flags and
deprecating others before people start migrating to 4.12 (after all,
GPIO_OPEN_DRAIN has been around since 4.4 even if there are no in-kernel
users).

Or we accept the binary interface breakage -- it probably is pretty rare
that people update the kernel without updating the dtb. I can just
update the dts on the system that broke for me, and hopefully anyone
debugging this issue while updating to 4.12 will find this mail quickly.
