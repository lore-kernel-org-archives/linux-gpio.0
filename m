The most complex PRCMs (that we know of) are the A80 and the A83T.
Some code can be found for A33 and A64. I cannot find where I got
the information for the A23. I probably assumed it was similar to
the A31.

The parts we know that are constant across SoCs are the register
offsets for the CPUS, APBS, APBS bus gates and reset controls.
The APBS divider is slightly different. Offsets for the gates
and reset controls are fairly standardized, except for the trusted
watchdog on the A80. We can treat the A80 as the canonical source
of possible peripheral gates if you want to do a single driver
for all SoCs.

Also the A8X chips have extra muxes for osc24M not available on
other chips. This should be made available for the main CCU on
them.

As for the ones that already have an MFD binding, it is possible
to support it even with the new driver. It's just going to be
messy as hell.
