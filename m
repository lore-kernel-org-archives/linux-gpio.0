That sounds crazy to me.  Some devices have thousands of registers.
At a line per register, that's thousands of lines of code/cruft.
Especially seeing as most (sane?) register layouts I've seen default
to zero.  Then default values can be changed at the leisure of the
s/w.

Even if it is absolutely critical that you have to supply these to
Regmap up-front, instead of on first use/read, why can't you just
supply the oddball non-zero ones?

I understand why they normally exist (sometimes people are just lazy
too) (Mark: BTW chicken-bits sound delicious!).  They're just ugly
from an Open Source PoV.

My issue is that we have one end of the scale, where contributors are
submitting patches, trying to remove a line of code here, a line of
code there, then there are patches like this one which describe the
initial value, readable status, writable status and volatile status of
each and every register.

The API is obscene and needs a re-work IMHO.

I really hope we do not really have to list every register, but *if we
absolutely must*, let's do it once:

  REG_ADDRESS, WRV, INITIAL_VALUE

Absolutely.  I didn't like it before.  I like it even less now.

I'm not at ELCE I'm afraid.

My issue isn't where all this bumph lives.

It's the fact that it's required (at least at this level) at all.

Please do.  And tell them to stop drinking at lunch time. ;)

The I suggest moving everything to DT.

That's against convention.

If a source file needs a head, it should include it explicitly.

I just looked at the maps, which appeared to be vastly different.
