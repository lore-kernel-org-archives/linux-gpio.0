Hi sorry for the late response but I was on vacation.

Well to be honest the HW people did and it's all I could test with.  I don't
know much about these naming schemes, apart from the intuition it has to do
with frequency and line levels.

What do you mean by oldest? What would you suggest? it's funny because the chip
is going to be used on a new product that is meant to be produced for years.
