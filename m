Yes.  A recent firmware update enabled the "XPU" block which is being 
programmed with a select subset of individual GPIOs.  On our silicon, 
each TLMM GPIO is in a separate 64k page, and so the XPU can block any 
individual GPIO.  Any attempt to touch those registers causes an XPU 
violation which takes the whole system down.

I presume so.  The idea is that pinctrl-qdf2xxx/pinctrl-msm only submit 
pin ranges that are present in the ACPI tables.

Well, that's exactly what I'm trying to do with current patch set :-) 
It seems the most logical approach to me.  I don't understand the 
dislike for it.  What else are pin ranges for, other than to specify 
ranges of pins that can be accessed?

Another alternative was to enumerate all of the GPIOs starting from 0. 
So the first GPIO in ACPI would be gpio0, regardless of what gpio number 
it actually was.  E.g. GPIO 37 would appear as gpio0, GPIO 38 would 
appear as gpio1, and so on.  That also worked, but it meant that 
customers would need to figure out which GPIO that "gpio0" actually 
pointed to.  That was not acceptable, so I dropped it.

I'm at a loss on how else to do it.  I think a gpio_chip.available 
callback is far less elegant than define pin ranges.  There is no chance 
that unavailable GPIOs can be accessed because the physical addresses 
are not in the msm_pingroup array.  That is, groups[0].ctrl_reg == 0, 
not 0xFF02010000.
