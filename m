AFAIK there is still no standard way of updating just the ACPI tables.
You need various tools to "stitch" a full firmware image that can be
consumed by the update mechanism.

And I just sent a separate patch series for "ACPI overlays", similar
with the dynamic DT, with the primary goal of supporting open-ended
hardware configurations.

But to be able to effectively use this we need a way to change pinmux settings.

Lets look at this from a different perspective. The proposal is not
about importing the DT model into ACPI but importing the Linux pinctrl
model into ACPI. That will allow us to use the Linux pinctrl drivers
to their full potential.

That doesn't stop the development of other, more OS independent, ACPI
models for pinmuxing. Which we can also support.

I know that there are some discussions for pinmux configuration in the
ASWG, but it does not match the Linux pinctrl model. So we will end up
with a pinctrl driver that offers groups, functions and pin names and
a totally different ACPI description that we can't map to the pinctrl
driver.
