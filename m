They are already merged, and in use :(

I would rather say we already have another instance of "line-name"
for this purpose. See
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt

"label" was not chosen because it's a Linuxism (that is what the internal
API is using) and not to the point.

I like the clear "line" specifier over "pin" etc since GPIOs can be
chip-internal and what not.

I prefer if the flags to be used for characteristics of the line rather
than driving it in any way. Anyway the input/output-low/output-high is
already merged, and in use for hogs.

We looked at using -gpios in a self-referential manner, but that
made it impossible to name the lines, and that is a desired
property. Hogged lines need names so we can figure out who is
using them during debug etc. It also makes the DT more
human-readable.
