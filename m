Hm it all boils down to this mfd/vexpress-sysreg.c driver that
spawns some MFD devices.

"basic-mmio-gpio" instantiating the drivers/gpio/gpio-generic.c

Specifically commit 974cc7b93441a0e78f030495436d1be7eb7c208d
that makes a layered MFD->gpio->gpio LED cake.
Needless to say neither the GPIO maintainers or the GPIO
mailing list was included in review of this patch and it was
merged on its MFD merits :(

It is sort of elegant in a way, but I don't like it when we describe
registers that are not general purpose as "general purpose input
output" it is simply ontologically wrong and a misleading hardware
description. These bits are not general purpose *at* *all* they are
special purpose.

It is Linux GPIO implementation details leaking into the hardware
description basically: it just happened to be very convenient to
describe these register bits as "gpios" as the drivers etc were
already in place.

I prefer syscon->syscon LED as a two layer cake
instead of a three layer cake involving GPIO and it's more to the point,
describing the hardware properly, so I say let's go for that instead.

For card detect and flash protection I suspect we can use
syscon as well, avoiding shoehorning a GPIO abstraction between
it.
