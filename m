That is not the issue. The real issue is h3xxx using those gpio's 
without previously calling gpio_request. Unfortunately sa1100 driver 
doesn't have a good place to request gpios. When faced this problem 
during locomo refactoring, I ended up with the following piece of code:

========== Cut here ============
static struct gpio collie_uart_gpio[] = {
         { COLLIE_GPIO_CTS, GPIOF_IN, "CTS" },
         { COLLIE_GPIO_RTS, GPIOF_OUT_INIT_LOW, "RTS" },
         { COLLIE_GPIO_DTR, GPIOF_OUT_INIT_LOW, "DTR" },
         { COLLIE_GPIO_DSR, GPIOF_IN, "DSR" },
};

static bool collie_uart_gpio_ok;

static void collie_uart_set_mctrl(struct uart_port *port, u_int mctrl)
{
         if (!collie_uart_gpio_ok) {
                 int rc = gpio_request_array(collie_uart_gpio,
                                 ARRAY_SIZE(collie_uart_gpio));
                 if (rc)
                         printk("collie_uart_set_mctrl: gpio request 
%d\n", rc);
                 else
                         collie_uart_gpio_ok = true;
         }

         if (collie_uart_gpio_ok) {
                 gpio_set_value(COLLIE_GPIO_RTS, !(mctrl & TIOCM_RTS));
                 gpio_set_value(COLLIE_GPIO_DTR, !(mctrl & TIOCM_DTR));
         }
}
=========== Cut here ===============

Same goes for get_mctr().

Russell, Linus, what do you think about the previous solution?


Another solution would be to make sa1100 distinguish between console 
output (where it doesn't have to control rts/dtr) and normal uart work 
(where 'modem' lines should be used).

I have the feeling that sa11x0-serial driver would need to be somewhat 
modified at least. I understand the conception behind unified 
"port_fns", but I think that those should be split to a per-port 
platform data.

That would be possible solution if we can't come up with usefull way to 
handle h3xxx (and collie) gpios.
