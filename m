So if the differences are actually hidden from software, why would we
care? See below for an example on using DT to cover this.

I would be fine with that if it really reflects something in the
hardware. And I like it more than the rather arbitrary sun50i name. But
on the other hand it seems to be completely unknown so far (Google just
turns up this email and your sunxi-fel setup, basically). So I am not
sure we should introduce yet another naming scheme.

So looking at the compatible definition in the DT, this looks like a
perfect example of a fall-back name to me:
=46or the Pine64 we use "allwinner,a64", any other board could use say =
a:
"allwinner,h64", "allwinner,a64" compatible naming.
So as long as we don't need any h64 specifics, going with the A64
support code is fine. Should later the need arise to fix something for
the H64 only, we can add this easily and be covered automatically.

=46WIW, I just have received this Remix Mini PC thing, which I ordered =
to
see what's with the H64 and to make sure the SoC/board abstraction is
right. So let me see what this version register looks like there and ho=
w
it behaves with the proposed kernel patches (should I be able to hack i=
t).

Cheers,
Andre.
