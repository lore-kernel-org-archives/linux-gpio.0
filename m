That's really valuable information to have. Thank you!

Ok, there's one more issue that Paul found (at least with the IPQ4019),
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/1099482

it seems that the "sleep_clk" node in the qcom-ipq4019.dtsi is not used by
the gcc-ipq4019.c clk driver. this causes both wifi rtc_clks and the usb sleep
clks to dangle in the /sys/kernel/debug/clk/clk_summary (from a RT-AC58U)

   clock                         enable_cnt  prepare_cnt        rate   accuracy   phase

with his patch the /sys/kernel/debug/clk/clk_summary looks "better" 

(something like this:)

   clock                         enable_cnt  prepare_cnt        rate   accuracy   phase
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 xo                                       9            9    48000000          0 0

but judging from your comment "SLEEP_CLK is derived from an
external 38.4MHZ crystal" the gcc_sleep_clk_src / sleep_clk
should have xo as the parent. so the ideal output should be:

   clock                         enable_cnt  prepare_cnt        rate   accuracy   phase

or am I missing/skipping over something important?
