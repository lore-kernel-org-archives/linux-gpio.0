Which makes a lot more sense, thanks.

It remains that none of that code supports EDGE_BOTH, so please remove
all traces of it in your next submission. With the right level of
abstraction, you'll be able to add it as a subsequent series, and it
will be easier to review once the basics are out of the way.

Thanks,
