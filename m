This would be a very unusual binding, because that requires the driver
to know the contents of the properties in advance and the driver
cannot derive the function of an irq from the position in the array.

Please come up with another approach that is more like other drivers
do this and that makes it possible to reuse the driver if the
interrupt numbers change.
