Well, yes there is one: As far as I can see it supports the bias-pull-up 
property.
My first intention was to have the doc as we have it in the right place, but 
you are right: It needs an update as well. I can do this, but Sebastian, 
please keep an eye on that.

As there are already patches depending on this patch (https://marc.info/?
l=linux-gpio&m=150726650325394&w=4) I would suggest, that you pull in this 
patch as is and I do the little update on the doc as a seperate patch.

Regards,
Lars
