Hi,

As a general thing, please put the binding earlier in a series than cod=
e
implemeting it, as that that makes it easier to review the series
in-order (with context from the binding making code review easier). See
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/submitting-patches.txt

Bindings should be for hardware (either specific device models, or for
classes), and not for Linux drivers. The latter is subject to arbitrary
changes while the former is not, as old hardware continues to exist and
does not change while drivers get completely reworked.

So please frame this binding document in terms of the class of hardware
you are trying to address. Please provide some introduction to the
assumptions that you are making about said hardware, such that it's
obvious when one needs a more specific binding.

I share the same fears that Rob mentioned in that while this may appear
simple now, the limitations are unclear, and this effectively prevents
us from accurately/specifically describing some hardware.

Regardless, I've taken the time to review the below, and I have a numbe=
r
of comments.

Even with the above comments, this binding name would be valid.

Below, we mention endianness. Are registers an arbitrary number of byte=
s
long? In what unit size are they grouped (e.g. {8,16,32,64}-bit)?

What are the expectations for the set/clear/dirin/dirout registers? Are
they write-one to modify, or write-zero to modify?

=46or the names, don't bother abbreviating (i.e. use "data", "set",
"clear").

These names might clash with the real names a specific HW model applies
to its register sets, which means that this binding is exclusive w.r.t.
a specific binding for a device (i.e. it cannot be extended with
device-specific information).

If we're happy with that, then we must call out the expected limitation=
s
on the use of this binding, or we end up with the not-so-simple-any-mor=
e
issues Rob mentioned previously.=20

Where the cells encode what? I'm guessing this is <$idx $flags>, but yo=
u
should spell that out explicitly.

I cannot parse this last description. It needs a better wording.

I guess this means that the indices (in the first GPIO cell) are applie=
d
in descending order for ascending chunks of the registers (and that is =
a
poor description, too).

Reword this in terms of the class of hardware you are trying to support=
,
(rather than the specific library code you are using), and move it to
the introduction at the top of the binding.

Thanks,
Mark.
