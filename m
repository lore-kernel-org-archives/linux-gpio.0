OK, I guess it's likely this won't cause any additional issue then. I
suspect most IRQ domains use within the context of device tree already
provide an explicit xlate op anyway; for example irq_domain_simple_ops
points at the default irq_domain_xlate_onetwocell.

The xlate function assumes that data is already converted to CPU-endian.
See:

irq_of_parse_and_map() ->
    of_irq_map_one() ->
        of_irq_map_raw() ->
            out_irq->specifier[i] = of_read_number(intspec +i, 1);
    irq_create_of_mapping()

(of_read_number does the be32_to_cpu() internally)
