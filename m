I'm not *that* fussed about it to justify starting-up wider community
discussions.

My only point is that:

  compatible =3D "<vendor>,udw9283";

=2E.. is meaningless gibberish and I think it'd be better to be more
forthcoming which prevents having to dig around in DTS files for the
node name/label for true device/type identification.
