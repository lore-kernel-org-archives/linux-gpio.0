OK I insist on using the generic bindings then.

That has nothing to do with whether you use generic pinconf or not.
I imagine if a pinctrl unit contains several blocks with individual
clocks you can either:

- Let each block/bank be a device node (this is common) and assign
  each a clocks = <&clock>;

- Keep one node and assign an array of clocks, affected block indicated
  by the index.
  clocks = <&clk1>, <&clk2>, <&clk3>, ... <clkN>;
  This property is in pluralis for this reason I guess.

True that, you need infrastructure first. The more important that it is
as good as possible.
