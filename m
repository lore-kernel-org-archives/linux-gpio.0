Hi Martin

Patches 1 and 4 don't seem to have and dependencies. So i would
suggest splitting them out and submitting them to netdev for merging
independent of the rest.

Linus can probably create a stable branch with the GPIO changes, which
David can pull into net-next, and then apply the stmmac changes on
top.
