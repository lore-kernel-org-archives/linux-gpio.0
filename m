Maybe I wasn't clear enough, and my use of gpio is probably wrong. So
Linux has a gpio number, which is obviously an abstract number (just
like the Linux irq number). But the pad number, in the context of given
SoC, is constant. So we have:

	pad->gpio
	hwirq->irq

Why can't you have pad == hwirq, always? This is already what you have
in the irqchip driver. This would simplify a lot of things.

You seem to assume linear mappings, which is pretty dangerous.

Is gpio_to_irq() supposed to allocate an interrupt? Or merely to report
the existence of a mapping?

Right. But that doesn't make it more reliable, see below.

That's the role of the HW to ensure that you don't loose any interrupt,
up to the sampling frequency of the controller. Doing it in SW is always
going to be a wonderful case of "it mostly work".

You always have a race between checking your level and switching the
configuration, which is likely to be slow anyway. In the meantime, the
level has changed and you're dead.

Anyway, I suggest you focus on getting something simple up and running,
and postpone the funky (read broken) stuff for later, once you have
something that looks vaguely sane (because we're not quite there yet).

Thanks,
