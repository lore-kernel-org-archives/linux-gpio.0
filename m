Hmm, I see now how the event handling in the gpio-keys driver differs
between irq mode and gpio mode, where gpio mode relies on getting
a separate event for the release. This is certainly something that
could be changed in the gpio-keys driver as an extension, but that
seems to be what Laxman Dewangan did when he introduced the irq-mode.

I thought we had solved that problem long ago when you first
submitted the driver.

Did 1b7047edfcfb25 ("genirq: Allow the irqchip state of an IRQ to be
save/restored") not address the problem for you? You were on
Cc to that patch and should have spoken up when the code that was
merged was not sufficient.

That's not perfect but better than the patch you sent here.
The main disadvantage is that you end up with two references
to the same IRQ. It can still work, but only as long as nothing
tries to walk the entire DT to parse all the interrupts properties.

It would be ok for gpio-keys, as that does not need both the state
and the event together, but for other gpio users, you still need a
working driver that supports reading the state and getting an
interrupt.
