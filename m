Hi All,

Here is v4 of my patch adding a driver for the ACPI INT0002 Virtual GPIO
device. When I started working on this driver using 4.11 as kernel this
fixed an irq-storm on irq 9, with some of the recent suspend-to-idle wakeup
changes which have landed in 4.12-rc1 this "driver" is necessary to fix
affected systems getting stuck in suspend when the user tries to wake
them through a peripheral which signals PME to the PMC to wakeup the system,
such as the xHCI controller.

As such ideally this driver should get added to a later 4.12-rc# as a
bugfix. Also see this linux-acpi mailinglist-thread:

Regards,

Hans
