OK, posted patches as:

[PATCH 2/2] arm64: tegra: Jetson-TX1: Add DT entry for system PMIC MAX77620
[PATCH 1/2] arm64: tegra: Add DT entry for keys used in Jetson-TX1
[PATCH 1/1] arm64: defconfig: Enable Maxim PMIC max77620 config

Currently, the execution is crashing with this series + above patches as 
MFD_CELLS are not correctly defined.
Discussion is going on with patch from Rhyland Klein
[PATCH] mfd: Fix MACRO for commonly declared MFD cell attributes

Once MFD_CELL defines get fixed, either series need to be revisit or 
automatically fix the issue.
