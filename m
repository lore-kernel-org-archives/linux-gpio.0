The SCU contains other miscellaneous functionality besides pinctrl
registers, but that's not relevant for the pinctrl bindings. This is an
example for the g5 SoCs demonstrating use of the aspeed,external-nodes
property, which isn't required for the g4 and is why I split the
examples.

Maybe I should split out the bindings for each SoC generation into
separate files?

You didn't comment on my approach here, but I'm interested in feedback.
 I've gone the route of fixed ordering of the phandles, but there are
two other approaches:

1. Relax the fixed ordering requirement by adding an "aspeed,external-
node-names" property and requiring correlated indices between them
2. Using separate properties for each required external node

Approach 1 seems pretty idiomatic and only crossed my mind after I'd
sent the patch. Approach 2 seems a bit ugly as the number of properties
scales with the number of controllers participating in the pinmux
configuration.

Something that also wasn't clear to me was whether I need the "aspeed"
prefix on the property name. What's the convention here? Do I need it
in this case?

Cheers,

Andrew
