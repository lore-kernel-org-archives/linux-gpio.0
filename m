OK I see. Hm I think it is better to use a per-soc compatible string
like Rob Herring indicates to determine if we should loose these
pin config parameters. Does it seem reasonable to you?

I'm thinking that it is a property of how the hardware was synthesized
in that SoC so since it is a different version of the hardware it should
have a unique compatible string.

So this stuff should not be in the device tree, the driver should know,
from the compatible string, what config options that are unavailable.

Then if someone tries to use that in the DT, they should get an
error code -ENOTSUPP, but AFAICT that is what the patch achieves.
