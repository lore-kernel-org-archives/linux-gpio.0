Hi,

This patch set reworks the Allwinner pinctrl driver to support the generic
pin configuration and multiplexing bindings.

In the process, we also covered some lasting issues that were found: we
were ignoring the case where no pull-up was set, and while our binding was
saying that the allwinner,drive and allwinner,pull properties were
optional, the code was not able to deal with the case where they were not
present.

Changes from v2:
  - Added Rob, Linus and Chen-Yu's acked-by
  - Removed unused variable
  - Dropped the patches already applied by Linus

Changes from v1:
  - Realloced the pinctrl_map array
  - Detailed the generic properties we support
  - Directly return the parsing functions return code
  - Called kfree on the pinconfig directly
  - Added Chen-Yu Acked-by
  - Changed the patch 2 commit log as suggested

Maxime Ripard (6):
  pinctrl: sunxi: Deal with configless pins
  pinctrl: sunxi: Support generic binding
  dt-bindings: pinctrl: Deprecate sunxi pinctrl bindings
  ARM: sunxi: Remove useless allwinner,drive property
  ARM: sunxi: Remove useless allwinner,pull property
  ARM: sunxi: Convert pinctrl nodes to generic bindings
