I don't think it makes sense to discuss technical aspects of the
proposed change, as I mentioned in the discussion yesterday I see no
technical issues at this point, and my changes are described as
nonfunctional.

The _nontechnical_ problem I see (well, may be I'm just blowing it up)
is a Linux kernel code style policy problem, to my knowledge the policy
of using bitwise and arithmetic operations on bool type variables and
constants is not defined, and since the policy is not yet defined I'm
glad to take part in its discussion now.

As an example of one related policy is change of 0/1 constants to
false/true, when they are attended by bool type, see c2b49ae678b ,
5c216cc3f37 , 7eef08554ca , bool{init,return}.cocci etc.

One may say that the changes above has no value (however it might be
related to ABI treatment of _Bool/bool), personally I agree with this
accepted code policy.

Another code policy question is to which degree arithmetic and bitwise
operations on bool variables and constants are acceptable. In my
personal opinion arithmetic and bitwise operations on bool variables are
quite undesired, that's why I attempt to replace them in advance in some
sound/soc/codecs/* functions before changing the type of input variable
representing GPIO level from int to bool. I guess in your personal
opinion this proposed change has no technical sense, I respect your
opinion and do not insist on my answer to the policy.

My little deal is to let you know that there is another opinion on the
subject and send you the changes for review and ack/nak verdict.
