This case is 4-bit iteration for the sake of example, but the idea is
to have the for_each_set_port_word macro to be capable of 8-bit
iteration, as well as any other number of bits, as specified by the
port_size parameter.

That's a good idea. I'll add in some test cases to lib/test_bitmap.c to
help check the implementation of these functions and macro.
