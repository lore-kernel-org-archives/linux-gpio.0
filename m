But why are those number different? Why don't you use the same
namespace? If gpio == hwirq, all your problems are already solved. If
you don't find the mapping in the irqdomain, then there is no irq, end
of story. What am I missing?

I really don't see what another irqdomain brings to the table. This is
not a separate piece of HW, so the hwirq:irq mapping is still the same.
I fail to see what the benefit is.

Being already done doesn't make it reliable. If the line goes low
between latching the rising edge and reprogramming the trigger, you've
lost at least *two* interrupts (the falling edge and the following
rising edge).
