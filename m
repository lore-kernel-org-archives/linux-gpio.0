In acpi case, single_ended is not handled. It only handles the active LOW.

 From code:


        bool active_low = false;
         bool single_ended = false;
         int ret;

         if (!fwnode)
                 return ERR_PTR(-EINVAL);

         if (is_of_node(fwnode)) {
                 enum of_gpio_flags flags;

                 desc = of_get_named_gpiod_flags(to_of_node(fwnode), 
propname,
                                                 index, &flags);
                 if (!IS_ERR(desc)) {
                         active_low = flags & OF_GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW;
                         single_ended = flags & OF_GPIO_SINGLE_ENDED;
                 }
         } else if (is_acpi_node(fwnode)) {
                 struct acpi_gpio_info info;

                 desc = acpi_node_get_gpiod(fwnode, propname, index, &info);
                 if (!IS_ERR(desc))
                         active_low = info.polarity == GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW;
         }
