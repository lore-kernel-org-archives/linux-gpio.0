How do you find my proposal about introducing ownership level (not
requested yet; exclusive; shared)?

Confirm with caveat that this is a fix for subset of cases.

I think it doesn't cover cases when you have UART + UART + GPIO (I
posted early a use case example).

But at least it doesn't move things in a wrong direction.

For these cases looks OK to me.
