I didn't think the controversery part would be about having this
information in a driver or in the device tree. I think there are pros
and cons for both cases.

We already have this description in our dt file with the previous at91
pin controller and I think it is a good thing to not have to update the
driver for each new SoC using the same pio controller. Tables could become
huge, embedding several one into a 'single zImage' is something I am not
confortable with. I know that some people could tell me that doing that
may increase the boot time.                                     
                                                                                
We should debate about this patch later. If there is no acceptance for
the previous one, I have to clarify if I need it.
