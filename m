Indeed the document does not mention that they have to be provided by
public.

In the same time these are statements given by a reviewer ("By offering
my Reviewed-by: tag, I state that:")... and how can you validate a
statement given through a private channel? Is it true? Is it a thorough
testing or just copy-paste from Gerrit (or other automated system)?
