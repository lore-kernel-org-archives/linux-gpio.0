Sob, I tried so hard to implement pin control referring to generic
concepts that everyone should be able to reuse. E.g. stressing SI
units to be used all over the place, neutral scientific terms for all
config options and what not.

The multiplexing with groups and functions is a simple (aehm,
OK, super-complicated) matter of mapping disjunct sets onto each
other, so that comes from logic.

Not even the GPIO ranges that map GPIOs to pin ranges are very
Linux-specific: it is a property of the hardware that sometimes
GPIO is "behind" the pin, in a distinct hardware unit. (See pinctrl.txt
for the GPIO pitfalls.)

If I was to rewrite pin control and GPIO from scratch I would make it
one subsystem instead of two. This is more of an architectural
choice. GPIO would still be a stand-alone part of it.

Yours,
