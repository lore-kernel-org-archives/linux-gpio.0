OK, that seems plausible.  ...so it is OK to set both
"bias-high-impedance" _and_ "bias-pull-up" on a pin?  That seemed
weird to me but if that's right I can do that and try to implement
"bias-high-impedance" on Rockchip...


Maybe better to explain the problem.  I have a pin that I wish to
drive high weakly (using a pullup rather than actually pushing
output-high to the pin).  The firmware has left the pin configured as
an output with no pull.

I can configure the pin like this:
  rockchip,pins = <7 12 RK_FUNC_GPIO &pcfg_pull_up>;

  pcfg_pull_up: pcfg-pull-up {
    bias-pull-up;
  };

When I do this the current Rockchip pinctrl driver will _not_
configure me as an input.  It will happily flip the "pullup" bit in
hardware and leave the pin configured as an output.

I could certainly reach into the GPIO controller part of things
whenever I see "bias-pull-up" and configure the pin as an input.  I
guess that wouldn't actually hurt to do even if the pin wasn't
configured as a GPIO...  In other words, if someone has:
  rockchip,pins = <6 22 RK_FUNC_1 &pcfg_pull_up>;

...it doesn't hurt to set the GPIO controller for this pin to be an
input because it's not used when RK_FUNC_1 is used.


A third option that would work in my case (and actually be sorta
clean) would be to implement a faux open-drain output.  The hardware
itself doesn't have a concept of open drain (unlike some SoCs) but I
could implement it by swapping between "input pulled up" and "output
driven low".
