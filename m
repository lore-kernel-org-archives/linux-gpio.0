Let's resume :
In the mainline meson pinctrl driver, we have :
 - pins that represent the PAD name (GPIOX_3 or GPIODV_17)
 - groups that represent each physical "bit" we set in the control registers, each group can group 1 or multiple physical pins
For example, the "emmc_nand_d07" sets the mode of multiple pins.
 - functions are a purely logical set of groups

The only C function handling the "function" is :
static int meson_pmx_set_mux(func_num, group_num)
{
...
	struct meson_pmx_func *func = &pc->data->funcs[func_num];
...
	/* Function 0 (GPIO) doesn't need any additional setting */
	if (func_num)
		ret = regmap_update_bits(...);
...
}

So we could have only two big functions :
is_gpio
is_not_gpio

But now we group every logically similar "groups" into the same function, like :
static const char * const uart_a_groups[] = {
	"uart_tx_a", "uart_rx_a", "uart_cts_a", "uart_rts_a",
};

When I pushed the PWM pins, I did not knew how to handle the fact that the same signal
is on multiple physical pins, so I added multiple functions for each physical pin mode.

What jerome pointed is that instead of :
static const char * const pwm_a_x_groups[] = {
	"pwm_a_x",
};

static const char * const pwm_a_y_groups[] = {
	"pwm_a_y",
};

we could have single :
static const char * const pwm_a_groups[] = {
	"pwm_a_x", "pwm_a_y",
};

But we should also change the DT accordingly.

So we can see that from different perspective :
- from the "pin" perspective : they are different functions, so we leave like it's already mainline
- from the "signal" perspective : they are the same signal, so we should group
- both, so we set a function per groupable groups.

for example, on the GXL, we can have UART_AO_B TX&RX on multiple pins, so we can have either :
static const char * const uart_ao_b_groups[] = {
 	"uart_tx_ao_b", "uart_rx_ao_b", "uart_cts_ao_b", "uart_rts_ao_b",
	"uart_tx_ao_b_0", "uart_rx_ao_b_1",
};

or

static const char * const uart_ao_b_groups[] = {
 	"uart_tx_ao_b", "uart_rx_ao_b", "uart_cts_ao_b", "uart_rts_ao_b",
};

static const char * const uart_ao_b_0_1_groups[] = {
	"uart_tx_ao_b_0", "uart_rx_ao_b_1",
};

or

static const char * const uart_ao_b_groups[] = {
 	"uart_tx_ao_b", "uart_rx_ao_b", "uart_cts_ao_b", "uart_rts_ao_b",
};

static const char * const uart_ao_b_0_1_groups[] = {
 	"uart_tx_ao_b_0", "uart_rx_ao_b_1", "uart_cts_ao_b", "uart_rts_ao_b",
};

The three of these are correct.
The point Jerome asked was for solution 1, and it what I pushed
The solution 2 is how functions are today.

The third solution is less easy but still valid.

What I want is :
 - since it's purely logical, it's not very important and each solution is still valid from
all perspectives, so leave the PWM functions like this and push new PWMs in the same way
 - The next functions should behave like solution 1, or solution 3 if better
