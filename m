Hmm well typically a device driver that loses it's context just does
save and restore of the registers in runtime PM suspend/resume
as needed. In this case it would mean duplicating the state for
potentially for hundreds of registers.. So using the existing
state in the pinctrl subsystem totally makes sense for the pins.

Florian do you have other reasons why this should be done in the
pinctrl framework instead of the driver? Might be worth describing
the reasoning in the patch descriptions :)

So as long as the pinctrl framework state is used to restore the
state by the pinctrl driver instead of the pinctrl consumer drivers,
I don't have issues with this patchset. So probably just improving
the patch messages a bit should do it.

FYI, on omaps, the PRCM hardware saves and restores the pinctrl
state so this has not been so far an issue.

Regards,

Tony
