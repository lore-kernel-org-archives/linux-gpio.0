You are right that we can get this working without this patch. The issue
that I experienced was caused by the interrupts property on the
spmi-gpio node. I thought that I tested this with that configuration but
I obviously didn't.

qcom-pm8941.dtsi and qcom-pma8084.dtsi are the only two in-tree users of
spmi-gpio. I'll include the fix for qcom-pma8084.dtsi as well.
