Thanks for the example. I think for my cases these drivers are exactly
the right thing.

I fully agree and you don't have to convince me. But to a lot of our
customers that are used to use FPGAs, SOCs and Linux are pretty new. Yo=
u
see a lot of scary stuff. Accessing /dev/mem seems to be a lot of
people's big hammer solution for everything. Then I always perceive it
as great progress if things like the sysfs interface are used instead.
