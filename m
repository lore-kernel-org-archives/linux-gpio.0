Not the biggest issue in the world. But I maintain a huge stack
of GPIO drivers and it drives me crazy that each one has to bear
the mark of the authors habits rather than mine.

I understand. But at the same time, the kernel needs to have the
right idea of what it is dealing with here.

The generic IRQ handling code will take a shorter fastpath if
you are using hierarchical irqdomain (I think?) but I can't claim
to be an expert. When in doubt, consult Marc Z.
