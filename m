I have to echo Mark's concern: wholesale importation of portions of current
DT bindings simply because it's expedient is one of the things I've been hoping
to avoid.  These patches seem to be just that.

And while the latest version mentioned above describes a bit of a review
process to handle this case, I don't recall the kernel community at large
agreeing to it, nor to it having been implemented.  If I missed that part,
my apologies; please let me know where it was decided.  If I haven't, then
perhaps this needs to be the first test case of that process.
