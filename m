Hmm... It's supposed to be name of the owner of the pin range (pin
control device name IIUC).

Don't we have means to do that?

At least that what I see in aspeed_gpio_set_config().

Or I missed a point here?

Any elaborated example?

I think we need something more generic in core than producing more API
functions.

But I would like to get problem first.

Hmm... My understanding that GPIO is just a (special) function out of
pin muxing. So, doing musing is essential to get proper function out
of it.

Does your hardware considers this differently? If so, I would really
want to see some datasheets.
