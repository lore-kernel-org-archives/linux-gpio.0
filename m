It's a good idea to cut out all of the code/comments that is either
not relevant, or you are not providing comment (besides "will do")
on.

I don't see how this is being used, so assuming the other Maintainers
are happy with the implementation it's okay for this to live here.
However, please consider changing to something better than "value" or
"type".  Perhaps "varian"t or "model" or similar would be better?
