For having 32 lines per bank, the big problem here is the upper limit
of 256 GPIOs.  We would hit that limit on SoCs that already exist with
the SoC GPIOs alone, let alone any GPIO extenders.  I'm really not
sure what the right way would be to deal with that.

Anyway, I don't think I understand IRQ domains and irq_chip_generic
very well.  One possibility _might_ be to use multiple irq_chips.  But
from what I do understand, if there's only a single parent IRQ used by
all of the GPIO banks, in order to use an irq_chip per bank, this
would have to stop using the chained irq logic because the parent IRQ
is shared across banks, and that implementation seems unnecessarily
confusing.  Any other ideas?

Best regards,
Gregory
