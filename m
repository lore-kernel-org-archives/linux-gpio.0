All modern Intel SoCs have GPIO count in between of ~230-380.
Though, few of them are split to communities by (much) less than 256
pin in each when there is a 1:1 mapping between community and
gpiochip.

OTOH, the function you are fixing is most likely is not used together
with the drivers for x86.
