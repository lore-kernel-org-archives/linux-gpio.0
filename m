Ok, it's easier to understand like that.

Honestly I don't know. When "devm_free_irq" is called to release virq, 
there is no issue and interrupt is well masked. But, when I tried to use
"irq_dispose_mapping(virq)" I observed that .free is called (child and 
parent domain) but interrupt is not masked.
