If you don't provide gpio_to_irq, you won't support the drivers which only
request a gpio through DT (because they need to read the pin state) and later
request an irq from it (to get an event and avoid polling)

That's a fairly common use-case. IMHO, this callback should be implemented by
the gpio controller, when it is an interrupt controller.

Yes you can. The HW does *not* support IRQ_BOTH on an irq line. You are trying
to come up with a SW workaround to get this feature. W/O this workaround, there
no reason to allocate a parent irq in set_type.
At this point, no one has come up with a clean solution to add this feature to
the meson-gpio-irq device.
Maybe evolutions in the irq framework will allow this cleanly in the future, I
don't think this is the case right now.

"You'd consider" maybe, but the fact is that it is not mandatory. Having irq
based card detect (or buttons, or jack insert, or whatever) is probably more
elegant, but the polled version also works well. Elegant and mandatory are not
the same things
