I probably didn't do that good a job explaining it then. Let's try
again. You want to use hierarchical domains when you want to describe an
interrupt whose path traverses multiple controllers without ever being
multiplexed with other signals. As long as you have this 1:1
relationship between controllers, you can use them.

Man, I don't even trust myself... ;-)
