I guess the design was more playing to the fact that in the
Arizona case we arn't really setting any register bit for the
persisence, we are just not letting the CODEC power down whilst
the GPIO is in use. The config approach does make more sense in
the case where you are actually setting register bits.

I don't have any great objection to keeping the persistence state
in the Arizona GPIO driver, but it does seem to be duplicating
the state a little. Also an early version of the patch chain did
that and we decided it would better in the core.

I am not opposed to option 3 either. For example open-drain has
a similar setup where there is a pin config option for it and
also a GPIO function call to check for its presence on a specific
GPIO. Certainly my objection was just that we were equating the
very generic property to a very specific pinconf.

I think I would probably be keen to see what Linus's thoughts
are, but my feelings are really your patch is probably good if we
just rename the RESET_TOLERANT pinconf to something a little more
generic.

Thanks,
Charles
