The configuration of_node is there to override the device one if there
were some reason to do it.  This should only happen in a situation where
we weren't able to use the core parsing, with modern drivers it
indicates a problematic binding so the code deliberately doesn't handle
it.  Anything with a problematic binding will have generated the
init_data in driver code anyway.  If we come up with a reason to extend
the interface we can do that but for now there is no need.

Line number references are complately unhelpful if you don't say what
you're looking at (for me that's a call to irq_find_mapping() which I'm
guessing isn't what you were talking about).

No, they both do the same thing.
