Hi Linus,

This patchset adds pinconf support for Bitmain BM1880 SoC. In the previous
patchset adding pinctrl support, I declared that the SoC doesn't support
pinconf settings but further interaction with Bitmain engineers revealed
that the SoC does support it and hence this patchset.

Currently, there is no drive strength support added but it will come later.
Also, the current driver has some code to set pinmux in dedicated PWM
registers separately which is not needed, so I removed those and simplified
the driver.

Thanks,
Mani
