Currently GPIO ACPI library provides an API to get a GPIO resources
(IO or interrupt) from ACPI tables for the individual drivers.

This library has few flaws which makes some devices not working:
 - the library allows to abuse ACPI by using a _CRS fallback mechanism
 - the library neglects flags of the resource

In this series:
 - the _CRS fallback is forbidden
 - the pin configuration follows what firmware wants to
 - the documentation is updated in order to clarify corner cases

After this series it's possible to use GPIO pins for input (interrupt)
which were configured as output by BIOS by some reason. It's a crucial
functionality for IoT open connected boards where user may choose any of
available pin for almost any of available function, including GPIO input
(interrupt).

Current bad behaviour was first reported by Jarkko Nikula few months ago.
