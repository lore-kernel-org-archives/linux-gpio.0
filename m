That is what is referred to as "rail name" above. If they really choose
that name on a schematic, then it is the right name for it.

Yeah well, the problem goes for clk-output-names that it's derived
from as well, it comes from the DT syntactic limitations.

Sure. Just waiting for DT maintainers and other stakeholders' input at
this point.
