...except the "seeems" typo which I just noticed.
thank you for sanity-checking this so far!

I'm changing this logic with earlier patches of this series.
can you please look at these as well because GPIO_OPEN_SOURCE doesn't
work with the old version of stmmac_mdio_reset() that you are showing.

let me write down what I definitely know so far

the RTL8211F PHY wants the reset line to be LOW for a few milliseconds
to put it into reset mode.
driving the reset line HIGH again takes it out of reset.

Odroid-N2's schematics [0] (page 30) shows that there's a pull-up for
the PHYRSTB pin, which is also connected to the NRST signal which is
GPIOZ_15

my understanding is that the pull-up resistor holds it out of reset
driving GPIOZ_15's (open drain) output LOW pulls the signal to ground
and asserts the reset

thank you for looking into this!
