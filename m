There had better be some good reason besides just wanting to make a
single virtual controller.

My point is that "cascaded-gpio" is not something used to parse the
binding and will never be an accepted compatible string. I know it is
an example, but you should make that obvious like foocorp is.

Uh, no! Practically every gpio controller is also an interrupt
controller (in DT) and devices pretty much always see just an
interrupt line. Just go look at all the I2C devices with an interrupt
line. Unless devices have some special needs to control the gpio, we
always use interrupts. Expansion boards may be dealing with the GPIO
simply because that is the only option for userspace drivers.
