Hello Linus,

It's me again, so I have been thinking about the problem originally
reported in: [PATCH fixes v3] pinctrl: Really force states during suspend/resume

and other similar patches a while ago, and this new version allows a platform
using pinctrl-single to specify whether its pins are going to lose their state
during a system deep sleep.

Note that this is still checked at the pinctrl_select_state() because consumers
of the pinctrl API might be calling this from their suspend/resume functions
and should not have to know whether the provider does lose its pin states.

Thanks!
