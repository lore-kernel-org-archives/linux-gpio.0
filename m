Spell out these acronyms so I have at least a faint chance of understanding
what is going on here.

So are you saying that some firmware dork has modeled something that
*is* *actually* a port to a PMC (I guess power management controller) to
send a PME (I guess power managment enable signal?) by shoehorning that
into something purporting to be a GPIO (general purpose input/output)
controller?

Well I've been approached before by people all over that just wanna stick
something quick and dirty into the GPIO subsystem because it's so
convenient. ("Come on, just take it", etc.)

I usually just say no. General purpose I/O is not special-purpose I/O.
I bet a million to one these are just a few bits in a register, right?
And someone chose to model that as a "GPIO"?

This takes the price.

Now we have not just lazy kernel programmers but lazy ACPI firmware
authors having to have their sloppy stuff cleaned up by Hans in kernelspace.

And I bet the resource resolution for this thing is completely dependent on
dirvers/gpio/gpiolib-acpi.c so it must be a using GPIO for that reason?

I guess that just force me to not NACK this because I don't want to screw
up all the worlds Intel cherryviews etc.

:(

So again, the reason this - which is not a GPIO controller at all -
should anyways
be in drivers/gpio/ is that some firmware person think it's convenient?

Shouldn't this rather be in drivers/platform/x86?

You can still use the gpio driver abstraction.

I have some small comments on the code as well, will send in a separate
mail, otherwise good work as always Hans.
