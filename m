Userspace is supposed to use the whole filepath in sysfs to identify
a device. That should be enough, no matter what name the chip has.

Also: see the ongoing discussion and proposed patch for a new
userspace ABI based on a character device. We're not too happy about
new userspace usecases for GPIO right now, we need to fix the ABI.

So do we think that other hardware will have this property too or is it an
nxp,* thing?

OK let's look closer at it.

OK, and should it be an nxp,* property?

OMG that sounds so weird.
