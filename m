Does it? If you just add a lookup table and keep using the integer-based 
GPIO interface, then your lookup table will not be used by anyone and 
will basically be a no-op. Then you can switch to the GPIO descriptor 
interface and take advantage of the lookup table. Unless I missed 
something there should not be any point that breaks in the git history.

(to be clear: the first patch should *only* contain the lookup table, 
and the second be a merge of the current patches 1 and 3 of this series.)

IIUC platform changes should be distinct from drivers whenever possible, 
so this is probably not the best choice here.
