And this is not working :( Each irq_domain has to be assigned to separate DT node,
otherwise IRQ mapping will not work (most probably will work, but only for bank 0)

Such kind of GPIO controllers are incompatible with gpiochip_irqchip_add() and required
to have one, common irq_domain for all internal banks.

like 	irq_domain = irq_domain_add_xxx(dev->of_node, ngpio, irq, 0,
							&davinci_gpio_irq_ops,
							chips);

ngpio = 120 in case of bcm7445.dtsi
and custom .map() function need to be implemented 

More or less similar situation is with davinci_gpio.

this is valid use case

Yah, custom implementation might be needed.

Another interesting, related question (as for me) is "Is there a limitation
 that gpio bank can have only 32 GPIO pins (from gpiolib point of view)?"
