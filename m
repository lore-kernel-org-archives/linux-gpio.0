So it's not just going to be GPIOs I take it?

There is going to be regulator forwarding, clock forwarding, pin control
forwarding, IRQ forwarding and DMA channel forwarding etc at the end
of the day?

I think it's strange that we see this so much, is the real problem that
ACPI and the kernel have different ideas of what constitutes a device?
And how come the DT seems to be a much better fit and not experience
this? Because we haven't had to deal with deployed device trees with
resources (GPIOs, regulators, etc) bound to some complex MFD device?
