Not only temporarily. For example on/off switch of some hw on board lik=
e gsm modem.
Or some optocoupler isoleted in/outs for general use from userspace.

This is our case of gpio. It's like LEDs, they are hw layout of board,
but they are in/out instead of LEDs are only output.

I don't think so as I explained - HW layout of boerd.
In other way I'm looking forward for DT overlays.

But isn't it nice to have already exported gpios which are layouted out
from board. All other unexported gpios aren't connected to anywhere on
board. So user don't have to export or unexport anything.

They are NOT removable.

But if you buy more "real world ready" board with for example 8 power
outputs for sprinkler valves, why has user think about what gpio to
export, if there could be valve0 - 7 ready. If he will use only valve0
does not mater, all unused gpio can't be used for anything else since
they has layout for valves.

I seriously think about it, but I think if LEDs are in DT, GPIOs should
be there too. In other way, I don't like exporting without given name.
