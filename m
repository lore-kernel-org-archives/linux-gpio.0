It's is unfortunate that we need to potentially maintain this forever,
but it does not mean that we should not allow non-unique names in DT
going forward.

We have already moved away from the numbers through the introduction of
descriptors. What remains to define is a sane userspace interface. Until
then, let the sysfs-interface be as cumbersome to use as it always has
rather than introducing more (intermediate) ABI to maintain.
