No, that's totally wrong if you consider one of the most common use
cases out there...

Think about something like a Raspberry Pi, where you have a header with
GPIOs on it, which can be used for multiple different purposes (and are
even multiplexed with some on-SoC functions.)

"Firmware" can't know about all possible configurations of those IO pins.

That's why Raspberry Pi uses a userspace helper and programs stuff up
appropriately for the users application.
