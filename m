Yeah, it's OK -- I spotted that pull request later as well.

It's not a big deal in most specific instances, I'd say. It's just in
aggregate it becomes a bother.

So, just see this as a public reminder since we've seen it creep into
other driver trees a bit more lately. Mistakes will still happen but
try to keep it down. And for those who submit patches, feel free to
point out in the patch that you don't expect the driver/subsystem
maintainer to apply it to help them out.
