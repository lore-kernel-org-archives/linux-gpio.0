Ram, thanks for your answer. Unfortunately I missed this mail until
Christian posted the new version of the patch.

Unfortunately I don't understand the functions provided here, so I hope
you can help me better understand what's going on.

Christian has the following groups of pins for each function:

wifi0_uart: pin 8, 9, 11, 19 and 62
wifi0_uart0: pin 9 and 10
wifi0_uart1: pin 18 and 63

It's common to see alternative muxing of functions, so I'm guessing that
wifi0_uart1 is one of these. Is this correct?

But why is there 5 pins for RTS?

Why is receive (wifi0_uart0) two adjacent pins? Are they perhaps Rx and
Tx?

Why do we have a CTS line if we only have RxD, no TxD?

Why is there no RTS for this when it seems bidirectional?

Bjorn
