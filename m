...I don't agree that this logically follows. A caller might reasonably
expect not to find any bits set in positions other than those in mask. A
simple example would be caller that just tried to ask "are any of
_these_ inputs set"; it would be reasonable to implement that using
bitmap_empty() on the returned bitset, without first having to mask by
the mask he passed in.
