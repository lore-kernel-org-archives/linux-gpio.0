The point pushed by Jerome was purely cosmetic since the groups in the meson
pinctrl driver are purely cosmetic, since only the GPIO group is handled,
other groups are all handled the same.

This is because I pushed all the PWM pins in a separate group, but functionnaly
the internal signal (i.e. PWM F) is the same for multiple pins and should be
a single "PWM F" group instead of multiple ones.

My advice is to leave the PWM groups as is, and push new pins/functions/groups
grouped with the internal signal name if split on multiple pins.

This will be the case for audio, since the I2S pins can be configures on multiple
different pins.

Neil
