It certainly wouldn't be something often used (e.g. besides during
development) but that doesn't mean it should not be implemented.

That's why I said "separate, but related" above.

Indeed. We also have CONFIG_DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE which would try to
unbind this driver during probe if enabled.

Getting into the habit of properly cleaning up allocated and enabled
resources is only a good thing; it shows that the author has thought
this through and serves as documentation of what needs to be released in
both probe error paths and driver unbind callbacks.

Assumptions also change over time (e.g. deferred probe and
CONFIG_DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE), and by not taking such shortcuts we
are also preventing incomplete code from being copied and reproduced in
other drivers (e.g. on hotpluggable buses).

So, just add the remove callback (in a separate patch) and everything is
good.

Thanks,
Johan
