Do you just re-apply the previous state, or do you force a "fake" state
by moving to a state different than the current during suspend, just to
force a transition during resume?

Consumers may indeed have to call pinctrl_select_state() but because of
the current check that does:

if (p->state == state)

this is not happening, but you are absolutely right, consumers that wish
to see their pin state be (re)configured during driver resume absolutely
need to tell the core about it, I am not thinking about any of this
happening "under the hood", this absolutely would not be right.
