 Handling #BR faults caused by MPX

 When MPX is enabled, there are 2 new situations that can generate

 are a few ways this could be done. We don't think any of them are practical
 in the real-world, but here they are.
 
-Q: Can virtual space simply be reserved for the bounds tables so that we
-   never have to allocate them?
-A: MPX-enabled application will possibly create a lot of bounds tables in
-   process address space to save bounds information. These tables can take
-   up huge swaths of memory (as much as 80% of the memory on the system)
-   even if we clean them up aggressively. In the worst-case scenario, the
-   tables can be 4x the size of the data structure being tracked. IOW, a
-   1-page structure can require 4 bounds-table pages. An X-GB virtual
-   area needs 4*X GB of virtual space, plus 2GB for the bounds directory.
-   If we were to preallocate them for the 128TB of user virtual address
-   space, we would need to reserve 512TB+2GB, which is larger than the
-   entire virtual address space today. This means they can not be reserved
-   ahead of time. Also, a single process's pre-populated bounds directory
-   consumes 2GB of virtual *AND* physical memory. IOW, it's completely
-   infeasible to prepopulate bounds directories.
-
-Q: Can we preallocate bounds table space at the same time memory is
-   allocated which might contain pointers that might eventually need
-   bounds tables?
-A: This would work if we could hook the site of each and every memory
-   allocation syscall. This can be done for small, constrained applications.
-   But, it isn't practical at a larger scale since a given app has no
-   way of controlling how all the parts of the app might allocate memory
-   (think libraries). The kernel is really the only place to intercept
-   these calls.
-
-Q: Could a bounds fault be handed to userspace and the tables allocated
-   there in a signal handler instead of in the kernel?
-A: mmap() is not on the list of safe async handler functions and even
-   if mmap() would work it still requires locking or nasty tricks to
-   keep track of the allocation state there.
