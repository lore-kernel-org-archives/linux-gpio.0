Can we deal with that as a separate patch from this series? Like I said,
the code already uses '0' '1' and '2' for the existing codecs so making a
change to use #define means patching the code for the other codecs. That
is not part of adding WM8998 support and I don't like patches that make
unexpected extra side-effect changes that are not relevant to the actual
functionality being added by the patch. It's specially annoying when
cherry-picking or reverting those patches if they included some extra
code change.

If we can get this series submitted I can look at making a later patch
to improve readbility, but since this really is just a version number I
think it would be enough to rename the variable to hpdet_ip_version rather
than effectively doing #define TWO 2
