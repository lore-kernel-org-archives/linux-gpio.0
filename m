This is the patch series for TPS68470 PMIC that works as a camera PMIC.

The patch series provide the following 3 drivers, to help configure the voltage regulators, clocks and GPIOs provided by the TPS68470 PMIC, to be able to use the camera sensors connected to this PMIC.

TPS68470 MFD driver:
This is the multi function driver that initializes the TPS68470 PMIC and supports the GPIO and Op Region functions.

TPS68470 GPIO driver:
This is the PMIC GPIO driver that will be used by the OS GPIO layer, when the BIOS / firmware triggered GPIO access is done.

TPS68470 Op Region driver:
This is the driver that will be invoked, when the BIOS / firmware configures the voltage / clock for the sensors / vcm devices connected to the PMIC.

Update on 2 GPIO chips implementation over 1:
	- Attempted to implement 2 GPIO chips, but ran into couple of
	  issues in the kernel, so we couldn't get it to work.
	- It was decided to postpone this change, since it is not
	  critical

Changes in v6:
	- MFD driver:
	- Used non-zero return values from regmap_write/read() calls
	  to detect error conditions

Changes in v5:
	- MFD driver:
	- Fixed Kconfig description text
	- Addressed other comments from Lee, related to formatting

	- GPIO driver:
	- Formatted the file header text

	- Opregion driver:
	- Formatted the file header text

Changes in v4:
	- MFD driver:
	- Removed board specific code and FIXME comment
	- Moved i2c.h include from tps68470.h to tps68470.c
	- Moved the TPS68470 REVID read code after PMIC reset
	- Fixed typo in debug error message (on failure of
	  devm_mfd_add_devices() )
	- Enhanced dependency on I2C by changing it to I2C=y
	  (to fix build errors if I2C is built as module
	   e.g tps68470.c:71: undefined reference to `__devm_regmap_init_i2c'
	       tps68470.c:117: undefined reference to `i2c_register_driver')
	- Removed most of the unused header file definitions
	- Moved devm_mfd_add_devices() after PMIC resett
	- Used probe_new() and removed i2c_device_id table
	  
	  The following patch from Andy is needed for the driver to be
	  probed.
	  http://marc.info/?l=linux-acpi&m=150030081523885&w=2	
	  
	- GPIO driver:
	- Added newline at the end of Kconfig description
	- Updated commit message about the descriptive
	  names for the GPIOs and the typical usage model
	  of the GPIO driver

	- Opregion driver:
	- Added dependency on MFD_TPS68470
	- Converted 2 liner into one line code

Changes in v3:
	- MFD driver:
	- Removed GPIO lookup table
	- Reverted to probe() for consistency
	- Addressed other comments from Andy

	- GPIO driver:
	- Removed the code that initializes the default values
	  of GPIOs to zeros
	- Used gpiochip_get_data() to access data inside the gpio_chip
 
Changes in v2:
	- MFD driver:
	- Removed tps68470_* wrappers around regmap_* calls
	- Removed "struct tps68470"
	- used devm_mfd_add_devices and removed mutex in mfd driver
	- Added reasoning about the need of having mfd driver
	  as bool/builtin

	- Opregion driver:
	- renamed opregion driver file / internal symbol names
	  with tps68470_pmic*
	- Made opregion driver tables as const
	- Removed unused *handler_context in common handler
	- Replaced "int" with "unsigned int"
	- Changed to WARN macro to dev_warn()
	- Destroyed mutex on error
	- Added reasoning about the need of having Opregion driver
	  as bool/builtin
	
	- GPIO driver:
	- Implemented get_direction() in the GPIO driver
	- Setup gpio_chip.names
	- Moved the GPIO lookup table code inside mfd driver
	- Added reasoning about the need of having GPIO driver
	  as bool/builtin
