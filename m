Yes, that is because this macro is as you noted primarily a replacement
for the repetitive code used in the GPIO drivers; the GPIO drivers
require the index and offset in order to modify and store the requested
bit values and perform port I/O.

I put this macro up in the bitops code, but perhaps I should have left
it local to the GPIO subsystem since its so specific. This is one aspect
I want to determine: whether to keep this macro here or move it.

There may be benefit to develop a different macro more aligned with the
rest of the bitops code -- one where we do in fact return the direct
4-bit value for example. Essentially all the GPIO drivers need are the
index for the hardware I/O port and the index for the bitmap to store
the bits.

So we may be able to reimplement the for_each_set_clump to utilize a
simplier macro that returns the clump value, and then determine index
and offset up in the for_each_set_clump macro; that way we can keep the
generic clump value return code isolated from the code needed by the
GPIO drivers.

Ah, you are correct, if clump_size does not divide evenly into
BITS_PER_LONG then the macro skips the portion of bits that reside
across the boundary. This is an unintentional behavior that will need to
be fixed. I didn't notice this since the GPIO drivers utilizing the
macro so far have all used a clump_size that divides cleanly.

This might work. All that would need to change to support the GPIO
drivers is to return BIT_WORD(start) as index and offset as (start %
BITS_PER_LONG). These sets can be performed outside of bitmap_get_value,
thus allowing it to have a simplier interface for code that does not
require index/offset.
