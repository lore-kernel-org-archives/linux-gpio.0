Eventually, yes, it needs both. But they don't even have to be the
same driver, since they provide two different features. The only
reason we have that construct in the pio case is because they share
the same address space, but in the AXP case, the regmap and our mfd
take care of that already.

Yeah, the AXP209 also has an ADC connected to these pins.

I considered that, but I don't see how it would break the DT later. If
someone wants to enable say the ADC, he will of course have to add the
pinctrl driver, and the pinctrl handles, but the old DT will only
reference the gpio driver directly, which would still be something
that would work.

Thanks!
