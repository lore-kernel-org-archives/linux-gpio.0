As long as we don't need to do things like requesting a GPIO by (chip,
name) tuple, then there should indeed be no issue with having several
lines have the same name.

On the other hand, we want lines to be named precisely, and two lines
with the same name would indicate a lack of precision (they cannot
have *exactly* the same function, can they). So I'm a bit torn as to
whether we should enforce this or not.
