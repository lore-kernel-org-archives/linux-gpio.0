Oh, I've just checked ARM dts directory and found that=20
constructions like this:
	vendor,syscon =3D <&syscon_phandle>; /// or even this vendor,syscon =3D=
 <&syscon_phandle 0x60 2>;
are widely used as of now.
Also, According to the bindings doc, the Syscon is not a Linux specific=
 definition (mfd/syscon.txt).
