In each mvebu pinctl there are <soc>_mpp_ctrl_get/set force usage of
global mpp_base. In order not to use it this way the functions have to
be redesigned. IMO having an acces to pdev would be sufficient (please
see my proposal below), but yet I don't have a clear idea, how to do
it,

How about a following compromise:
Instead of forcing pm_info, we can add a generic pointer to struct
mvebu_pinctrl, e.g. void *priv; and enable passing it in a way I
proposed before.

This way each SoC-specific driver can attach whatever is needed for
its operation. For example in A38X/AXP it would be *base,
*mpp_saved_regs and nregs gathered in one structure, but it wouldn't
force anything specific for other machines. As a result in A38X/AXP in
suspend/resume routines, there would be no globals in use at all.

Best regards,
Marcin
