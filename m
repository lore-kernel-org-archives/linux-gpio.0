Sorry my bad. I need all 5 together in one place to actually test the =0A=
series.=0A=
=0A=
I wasn't sure whether the series should go through mvebu with Acks from =0A=
clk and pinctrl or if things should go to the separate maintainers and =0A=
come together when they hit the main linux repo. Up until the latest =0A=
pinctrl change either approach would have worked.=0A=
