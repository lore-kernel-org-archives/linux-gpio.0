I see in the documentation on device trees there are a number of 
categories I can use. GPIO is easy because it is one of the categories 
but I'm not sure about the new device I'm adding since the a10sr is a 
new device.

I believe I should only call out the name and address on the SPI bus like:

a10sr@0 {

and this would be a10sr_gpio: gpio-controller {

Does that seem correct?

I need to revisit where this will live (hwmon does not seem to be the 
correct place) so it will change but I can follow the format above if it 
is correct.

Thanks for reviewing.
