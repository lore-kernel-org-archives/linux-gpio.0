No, that's not what I wrote.

My point is that there's a mismatch between the license described in the
comment at the top of this file and the ident used in the
MODULE_LICENSE() macro. In my comments on v2 I wrote:
    By the way, you probably want to use "GPL v2" as the license ident
    [...].

In this v3 I noticed the same mismatch (which was not surprising because
you already stated that "GPL" actually did match what's stated at the
comment in the top of this file). Therefor I wrote:
    So only "GPL v2" matches what's found in the comment at top of this
    file.

There now seem to be a few options:
- change either the comment at the top of this file or the license ident
used in MODULE_LICENSE() to make them actually match;
- show that I misread the comment at top of this file;
- or show that my reading of module.h is incorrect.

(Another option would be a patch that somehow merges the "GPL" and "GPL
v2" license idents. That patch would put an end to discussions like the
one we're having here. I'm _not_ volunteering to submit it.)

Thanks,
