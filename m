no sure if it is possible. WiFi calibration data is kind of initval too.

Becouse it should not permanently hog a gpio. The "Hogging" should be
released as soon as some driver will request it.

Right now, if I define gpio-hog, boot loader will configure it and start
linux. But linux will never let it free.

If you have other suggestions which fit to this use case, please tell
me. I assume, right now I'm just blind.

Other way, I can imagine is to create real device nodes which use this
gpios. Compatible for this devices will be like this:
some_gpio_holder: gpio@0 {
	compatible = "gpio-for-userspace";
	gpio = <&gpio1 5 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
};

Boot loader will configure it as needed, an linux will do nothing with
it so it can be used over /dev/gpio interface.
