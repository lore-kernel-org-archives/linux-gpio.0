As they all stem from the same hardware block I suggest we name the
function "led".

For any software-driven LED control it makes sense to configure the pins
as gpio and just rely on the gpio-leds driver.

But as you have both hardware driven control and hardware blink support
it sounds like there's good reason to have a specific LED driver as
well.

Yes, that sounds reasonable

I do unfortunately not have access to the specification or either
platform, I would appreciate if you could post a reply on Varadarajan's
IPQ8074 patch asking him to verify the layout of the config register.

Better leave them out for now then.

Sounds good.
