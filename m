For DT bindings, it doesn't matter who manufactured the part, or which
technology was used (TTL, HC, LVC, ...).

Logically, the shiny new parts are compatible with the old ones, from as early
as the 1960s.

Especially for standard logic glue, where you can source parts from several
manufacturers, and which are available in many different technologies, it
doesn't make much sense to have all combinations in the DT bindings.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7400_series

Now, which one to pick?
Given the precedence set by the existing compatible value "fairchild,74hc595",
perhaps the most logical one to add is "fairchild,74hc594"?

Or can we just drop the manufacturer?
