Yes, open drain configuration and mux via pinctrl was something I
planned for later.
There was another reason for this as well, part of the gpio code I read
was confusing me. So I look through the other gpio documentations and
found an example that did this as well.

int of_gpio_simple_xlate(struct gpio_chip *gc,
                         const struct of_phandle_args *gpiospec, u32 *flags)
{
        /*
         * We're discouraging gpio_cells < 2, since that way you'll have to
         * write your own xlate function (that will have to retrive the GPIO
         * number and the flags from a single gpio cell -- this is possible,
         * but not recommended).
         */

Thanks, and please advise me on what to do next.
