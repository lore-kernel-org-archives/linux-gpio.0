One of the problems is that A64 name is not unique. We have reasons
to believe that there are also H64 and R18 out there using exactly
the same die, but possibly available in different packaging (a different
ball grid pitch? or maybe a different set of peripherals routed to the
outside?). Early prototypes of the Pine64 board were using Allwinner R18
and the Jide Remix Mini HTPC box is using Allwinner H64.

The bootloader sources from Allwinner are also referring to A64 as
AW1689, which makes some sense because it is the chip id number that
is accessible for runtime identification via reading the SRAM_VER_REG
hardware register:

    http://linux-sunxi.org/SRAM_Controller_Register_Guide#SRAM_VER_REG

So would it be a good idea to use "aw1689" as a compatible property
in the DT instead of "a64"? Or maybe have "aw1689-a64" and
"aw1689-h64", which would be similar to the existing "sun5i-a13"
and "sun5i-a10s" naming convention?
