Anyway please be sure that indentation is consistent.

I don't quite get... usually there is no need of casting pointer to a
writable memory when function accepts pointer to const.

You mean v2? Okay, let's wait for that...

Because this shouldn't be defined in header at the first place. Instead
define it in main MFD driver with EXPORT_SYMBOL() and put in headers
just declaration.
