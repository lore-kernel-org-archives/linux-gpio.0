Florian, I'm really sorry for losing track of this patch set, it's
important stuff and I see why systems are dependent on something
like this.

Tony: can you look at this from a pinctrl-single point of view?
This is the intended consumer: pinctrl-single users that lose the
hardware state over suspend/resume.

How do you see this working with other pinctrl-single users?

Yours,
Linus Walleij
