OK but pinctrl is something else. There is also the GPIO
OD configuration, as it modifies the behaviour of how to set
GPIO lines.

(Yes I know the frameworks maybe ought to talk to each other
for such things....)

So if you plan to do this, add it to the bindings even if you're not
adding the code for handling it right now.

Hm yeah that's right.

This check was added by Anton in 2008. Anton why did we discourage
onecell GPIOs?
