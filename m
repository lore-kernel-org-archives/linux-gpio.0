Well, I didn't see it much before, but that's also a reason to not put
it into the UART driver. :-)

Conceptually the construct is there not because the pin has an UART
function but because the pin is an output by default but should be an
input later. This is more related to the pinctrl part of the SoC than of
its UART IMHO. Also the GPIO is free to be activated once the pinmuxing
is setup, so the timing depends on the pinctrl driver. (Well, ok, once
the UART driver starts to act the pinctrl stuff is already done and so
the timing is fine, too. That's more a conceptual argument.)

Best regards
Uwe
