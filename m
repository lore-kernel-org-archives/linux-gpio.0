For this particular SoC it's SPI Slave Config; Registers found in the
holes on other SoCs:

* TestControl
* OscControl (just the name, no other documentation what it does)
* Switch LED control (for integrated switches)
* Legacy LED controller
* Reset Controller for the VDSL PHY

And there are also usually quite a few other registers on this block.
This seems to have been treated as a "GPIO and everything else that
isn't large enough for its own block" by Broadcom - with BCM6328/6362
they even introduced a "MISC" block then.
