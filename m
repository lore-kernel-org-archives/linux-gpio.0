Prestera switches (they are sold as standalone devices and with
integrated CPU's, like ones submitted) are as far from mv88e6xxx as
possible. There are various mix of 1/2.5/10/40G ports, depending on
model.

The difference is huge, nothing existing in the mainline can fit. The
driver, that exposes resources to the userspace SDK (called CPSS, it's
huge and complex piece of code) is existing in Marvell internal
branches (kernel v4.4 is the latest one), but I doubt such solution
(despite it's really small) is upstreamable. I believe it can be
shipped to the customers along with the SDK as a kernel module. Having
the CPU's support in the mainline is IMO sufficient.

Best regards,
Marcin
