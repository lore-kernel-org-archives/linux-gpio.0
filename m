There is no description of how the circuit really looks like and I
would very much prefer this not being a prerequisite to get some
software support in place.

The best description we have is from NXP AN5078:
"The drive strength enable (DSE) can be explained as series resistance
between an ideal driver's output and its load. To achieve maximal
transferred power, the impedance of the driver has to match the load
impedance."

Which means the control bits don't really vary the output impedance,
but the description models it like that. If we _assume_ the simple MOS
totempole setup then adding more totempoles will bring down the output
impedance.

So with this description in mind the drive-strength property doesn't
describe an actual real world drive-strength, but some maximum current
output under ideal load matching?

That's pretty confusing actually, as in a real-world setup increasing
the drive-strength property value might negatively affect the load
matching, leading to _decreasing_ the actual drive-strength.

So, just because the description of the drive-strength value uses some
(idealized) output impedance, we are now going to introduce yet another
property for the same thing? This is confusing to people reading the
reference manual, which never speaks about output-impedance, but always
about drive-strength.

Hardware people (the ones responsible to come up with the padctrl
settings) are much more likely to read the reference manual than any
idealized dt-binding. I want to make it as easy as possible for them to
match up the hardware and reference manual with the DT description.
So, can we please just keep the drive-strength property and deal with
it being described in different units in different hardware manuals?

Regards,
Lucas
