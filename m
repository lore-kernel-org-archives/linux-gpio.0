I agree that is a bit odd, my thinking was keeping the behaviour
the same for existing systems. But it only introduces a power
regression perhaps it is ok to require people to update their DT
to avoid that?

I certainly have no objections to making this a core feature if
you are comfortable with that. I will have a look at what that
would look like.
