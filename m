I am not quite sure if any real cases would route multiple DTEST line to
single GPIO, but the register mapping uses the bit mask for 4CH/8CH
subtypes and I think we should support it accordingly. Even if I drop
the support, we still have the difference of the register mapping on the
dtest selection between MV/LV subtypes and legacy 4CH/8CH subtypes,
which means we need a place to unify the dtest definition. I put the
complication here in dtsi which the end user would choose the right
value according to the hardware. I am also fine with putting the
complication in C code, but that would drop the supporting of multiple
DTEST lines selection for 4CH/8CH subtype.

Thanks for your suggestion, I got the issue here. 
PMIC_GPIO_LV_MV_DIG_IN_DTEST_EN need to be unmasked in the case of dtest
disabling.
If we decided to drop the multiple dtest line selection (actually I am 
fine with it) and unify the dtest lines values to 1~4 from dtsi, I am Ok 
with the suggestion of using 0 to represent "disabled".
