If the driver is not platform specific, then it would have no idea about
mapping between _CRS GPIOs and names. All such stuff should be hidden in
platform glue (i.e drivers/platform/x86/platform_crap.c).

I think that this wording is too x86-centric. We are talking about
consumers of GPIOs here (i.e. drivers), which need unified behavior
between ACPI, DT, and static board properties, they do not really care
about _CRS or _DSD.
