I probably do not understand what you're trying to do, sorry :(

Why is it necessary for the driver to copy one description of
the pin into another?

pinctrl does not even use sysfs.

The group names are usually there for matching with a function,
it is part of the core functionality. The group name + function name
matching is even more obvious in the dt case.

They also make things easier to read in debugfs yes, but
the core of the crux is to make it easy to config function+groups
states with e.g. DT or board files.

Device tree or not doesn't matter, .gpio_request_enable() is used
as a shortcut to mux in GPIO pins.

If the simultaneous use of a pin for a device and GPIO bothers
you there is nowadays (linux-next or my devel branch) a .strict
option in pinmux_ops that you can set to disallow simultaneous
use by devices and GPIO of the same pin.
