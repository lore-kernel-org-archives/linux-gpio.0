This patch series is partially based on a series Jerome Brunet
submitted about half a year ago. Due to open questions this series never
made it to mainline, see https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9384431/

This new attempt uses GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP resulting in less needed code.
Included is also support for using two parent IRQs in case
of IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH, like in the vendor driver.

Worth to be mentioned is also that I had to work around a strange
issue with spurious interrupts resulting in a deadlock.
The affected critical section in __setup_irq is executed with interrupts
disabled, nevertheless spurious GPIO IRQs result in a deadlock what
seems to indicate that they are handled on the same CPU.
I didn't find a better explanation than a possible HW flaw so far.

The series was successfully tested on a Odroid-C2, e.g. with removing
polling for SD card insertion/removal from the mmc driver.
