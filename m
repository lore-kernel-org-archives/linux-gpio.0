Yes.

The call to devm_of_platform_populate() in drivers/mfd/qcom-spmi-pmic.c
also triggers this condition. I'll experiment with this some more this
weekend.

Yes, I will do that work as well once this patch series is accepted.
I currently don't have the hardware to test it, but I'm willing to pick
up a cheap device on ebay. Any suggestions for something that boots a
mainline kernel with the ssbi? It looks like the Sony Xperia Z phone is
one of the supported devices.

Thanks for your review on the other patches. It all makes sense.
