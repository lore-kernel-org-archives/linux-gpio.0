=E2=80=A6 looking into this more closely, by the time we get into gpioc=
hip_add there=E2=80=99s no notion
of the DT node that is associated to the gpiochip being added (and the =
gpiochip->dev
points to the parent device, which is the generally the parent DT node)=
, so this can=E2=80=99t be
done generically without at least some churn in the individual drivers.
