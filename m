That's the question of bool type comprehension in my opinion. If bool is
seen from mathematical point of view, then arithmetic and bitwise
operations (except inapplicable shift) may be applied only if the result
is expected to be of bool type as well.

IIRC C95 doesn't define bool or _Bool at all, C99 implementations store
one bool value in one "char" (or one byte/8 bit memory cell), so
personally I'm not sure if arithmetic over boolean is so different from
arithmetic over char/unsigned char (with exception of implicit type and
value conversion).

Of course I'm not a C standard writer, but I have a feeling that one day
bool type may become quite distinct from int (or in other words bool
type will not be one of integer types). This may explain why C99 and C11
has "_Bool" type, not a hypothetically finalized in future "bool" type.
Also C99 clearly states that macro "false" and "true" may be undefined
and redefined to any arbitrary values.

I'm going to fix review comments and resend the series tomorrow, if you
find some of the changes wanted, please apply them, the rest may be
actually just covered by a simple function argument type change, which
hopefully happen in 4.2
