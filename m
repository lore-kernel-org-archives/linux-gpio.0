Why are different groups here? Do you want to put them into the dtsi?
This would mean you have to carry a lot of groups in each dtsi from
which only a small fraction is used. We did that on i.MX but no longer
do this since the dtbs get very big.

Did you have a look at the RFC I sent for these kind of controllers [1] and
the final result for the Mediatek driver currently in Linux-next [2]?.

The binding has both the config and the pins in a single node and thus
is very compact.
