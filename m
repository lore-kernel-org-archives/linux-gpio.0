Sorry for the unclarities, this is a bit hairy. Suggestions as to
how we can make it easier and/or bring code for this into gpiolib
are welcome. Right now I have a hard time seeing any way to
make this more generic and helpful :/

Overall this patch looks real nice. Some nitpicks below.

This should be <= 0 since 0 is NO_IRQ

Why should this code only execute if the node is marked
"interrupt-controller"? It makes it seem like IRQs cannot arrive
to it unless it is intended to serve other consumers.

Maybe in practice this is true, but...

Again 0 is NO_IRQ so this should be > 0 not >= 0.
