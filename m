Well, orthodox ACPI people from the Windows camp would definitely agree with you,
but I'm not one of them, so let me play a devil's advocate for a while. :-)

IMO, exposing anything in the ACPI tables without explicitly saying "but you
should not touch that", eg by defining an operation region covering it or similar,
is equivalent to giving the OS a license to play with that thing as it wishes.

Therefore I would regard exposing pin control information in cases when the
OS is not allowed to use it to its fit as a firmware bug.

Now, the question in this patch series is how to expose things and not when to
do that.  It adds support for a specific method of exposing information to the
OS, but should it be concerned about the possible consequences of inappropriate
use of that method by firmware?

Thanks,
Rafael
