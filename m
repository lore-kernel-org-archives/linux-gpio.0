Yes, I have been told this already. However I don't like this idea so
much, for the following reasons:
a) It is mostly redundant. The actual SoC (marketing) name is unique,
there is no sun6i-a20 or sun7i-a23.
b) It is not even helpful. If I got Maxime correctly, then the newer
sunxi generation numbers depend on the ARM _cores_ used in the SoC,
which is frankly the least interesting part from a Linux support
perspective. I would see some sense if it would reflect the generation
of IP blocks used, but so it is even more confusing to see that
sun7i-a20 and sun8i-a23 are related, but sun8i-h3 is a completely
different beast. The Allwinner marketing name tells you that, but the
sunxi one does not.
c) It is very confusing for people not dealing with it everyday. Just
because I own a BananaPi I know that the A20 is sun7i, but I am totally
lost when it comes to all the other names. And even now it took me about
a minute to find the appropriate Wiki page which explains part of that
story.
d) Most importantly ;-): It kills TAB completion, unless you know the
sunxi number, which is mostly not true as pointed out in c)

So while I see that just a<somenumber> is not really very specific, I'd
rather do away with current naming scheme for the future. In this
particular case we have the vendor name as a name space identifier
already, so there is no possible confusion with ARM Cortex naming, for
instance.

Also as this is now moving into the arm64 world, I'd like to use the
opportunity to fix things that are not really optimal, the naming is one
of them.

I can see the reasoning behind this particular one, as A64 is not very
specific. And indeed I had planned to replace this, but forgot it over
merging all the stuff together. However I'd rather go with the generic
"sunxi" as a stub name (PINCTRL_SUNXI_A64), as the "50" in there is now
completely stupi^Wconfusing and also kills my favorite sun.i regexp ;-)
I can see that the term "sunxi" is a shorthand for Allwinner in Linux,
so it looks reasonable to me to use that.

same as above, I'd like to go with pinctrl-sunxi-a64.o.

Indeed ;-) And it is more to type and may potentially break 80 character
lines, so if you don't mind, I keep it that way (or could add a "sunxi_"
if that is really asked for).

Thanks for looking at this and your input!

Cheers,
Andre.
