Very nice stuff!

I'm fairly sure the SPMI maintainer (Stephen Boyd) can just ACK the
patch once he's happy with it and I can then apply it all to
the pin control tree.

I'm a big fan of your work. I have a few of these devices as well,
so the day I manage to create a serial cable for it, I'll gladly test
this stuff and see what I can add.
