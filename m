For completely different purposes, yes. One takes DMI data to identify
platform, and ACPI _instance_ ID to identify the particular ACPI device;
there theoretically could be several of them.  If you have a better
option to identify the instance, we can switch to them.

The driver uses HID or CID to bind to one or more devices.

It is supposed to be crap. We have a vendor that neglected to describe
the device in firmware properly and instead expects the driver to be
recompiled for each device shipped. Bad, bad vendor. So we have crap in
platform/x86/... At least we do not smear this shit all over generic
driver.

As far as I see it works often enough.

Thanks.
