It appears that at least one current user (patch 3) and upcoming one
(patch 2) need to get device name by ACPI HID.

Here we introduce acpi_dev_get_first_match_name() based on code
done for acpi_dev_present() and reuse it where appropriate.

The series has been tested on Intel Edison with non-ACPI and
ACPI enabled versions of U-Boot, while patches 1 and 3 were tested
by Pierre.

Since patch 1 and cross subsystem nature of the series I think
the best way is to push this (patches 1 and 2) via Rafael's linux-pm tree.

Taking into consideration that patch 3 requires not-yet-applied work
from Pierre, I left it for reference, in particular to show the LOC
statistics.

Changelog v3:
- add Pierre's tag (I dared to do this for both patches 1 and 3)
- address comment about function name (patch 1)
- add a reference to the first user (patch 1)
- consolidate pin control device possible names in one place (patch 2)
- rebase ASoC patch on not-yet-applied series from Pierre (patch 3), and
- thus reordered to make it last in the series (patch 3)

Andy Shevchenko (3):
  ACPI / utils: Introduce acpi_dev_get_first_match_name()
  gpio: merrifield: Add support of ACPI enabled platforms
  ASoC: Intel - Convert to use acpi_dev_get_first_match_name()
