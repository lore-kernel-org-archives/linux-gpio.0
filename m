Then it should be done in .request() for the GPIO, not in
.to_irq().

It should *also* be done in the set-up path for the irqchip
side, if that line is used without any interaction with the
gpio side of things.

I don't understand this.

We are discussing an irqchip that is tightly coupled with
a gpiochip. Usually d->hwirq is the same as the GPIO offset
but that varies.

The point is that each IRQ that ever get used
has a 1-to-1 relationship to a certain GPIO line, and if that
relationship cannot be resolved from the irqchip side,
something is wrong. The irqchip needs to enable the
GPIO line it is backing to recieve interrupts without any
requirements that .to_irq() have been called first.

If to_irq() does something else than translate to an IRQ
something is wrong.
