Sorry, that was a dig at someone else ;)

I completely agree with the 1st sentence and disagree about the 2nd. The
ACPI ID usually describes a chip, much like DT compatible does, and
rarely is platform specific. For example, we have i2c-hid binding to
ACPI0C50 or PNP0C50. These are standard IDs shared between many
platforms. Same goes for various Silead IDs; Chromebooks use ATML0000
and ATML0001 for Atmel touch controllers, ELANXXXX for Elan controllers,
etc. All of them might have different connections, depending on platform
(i.e. on given platform firmware might be responsible for powering up
and resetting controller while on another it is done by the kernel). The
driver that is not platform specific should ideally not have
platform-specific knowledge in it, but instead get configuration from
elsewhere (device tree, acpi, board code, or platform driver augmenting
the former 3 sources, like we have with silead_dmi.c).

No. You need to split the part that augments incomplete ACPI data, and
move it somewhere (drivers/platform/x86/<platform>-crap.c; the driver
stays the same: a driver that is useful across multiple platforms.

It does work in many cases. By disallowing it completely you force much
more platform stuff knowledge in the kernel, whereas before you needed
to deal with exceptions.

Thanks.
