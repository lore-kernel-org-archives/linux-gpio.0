OK does it turn up in ftrace etc? I was thinking these would be
inlined by the compiler (especially since you even state they shall
be inlined) and the symbols trashed?

I was thinking the GPIO driver part should get a -EPROBE_DEFER when
trying to call gpiochip_add_pin_range() and continue later when the
pin controller is available?

And all drivers using GPIOs in turn get a -EPROBE_DEFER when
trying to get GPIOs on a not-yet registered GPIO chip.

Sorry if I don't really know how things work now... :(
It seems like a logical way to me.

Define exactly what you mean by "disable". There is
pinctrl_free_gpio().

The ranges shall definately be registered from the GPIO side of
the driver, that much I can tell you for sure...
