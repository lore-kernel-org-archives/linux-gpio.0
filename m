Agreed. It would better do not make any change for DT if possible. If k=
eeping the
two separate code paths, as presented above, I have to do those check l=
ike
"if (dev->of_node)" and covert back the fwnode to of_node, so as to par=
se IRQ
resource in DT. Andy think this patch looks unfinished if used to_of_no=
de.

Andy, do you think it acceptable if keeping two separate paths for DT a=
nd ACPI?
