Right, but in terms of end users that doesn't matter - the users that
Linus is concerned with here aren't going to know what ACPI is.

I'll need to find that series I guess...

Note that we currently don't have any actual mechanism to load a DT
overlay in mainline.  One of the issues there is making sure that the
external interfaces we're offering are actually stable, another is
making sure (for safety) that the overlays are only updating bits of the
device tree that corrspond to the bit of the hardware that the overlay
is for.

It's not like this is the only change that has been sent to reuse some
DT element rather directly in ACPI recently...

That's not really a great answer.  Regardless of how good a solution
this is for handling pinmuxing ACPI it needs to be joined up with the
rest of ACPI, we need some clear instructions for both firmware and OS
authors about how this works in a wider ACPI context and interacts with
other features, preferably in the ACPI specs where people can find them.

It could be something really simple like just saying that if we've got
these pinctrl definitions then the firmware is not allowed to do any pin
management, or it could be something more involved like saying that the
OS has to notify the OS before using them.

If there's an ASWG spec in progress that explicitly overlaps it seems
even more important that this is joined up - I'm not aware of what's
going on there.
