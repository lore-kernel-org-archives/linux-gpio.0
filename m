You know how soc vendors are working. We need to develop code out of
mainline for certain time because we can't share details before.

When we get permission to upstream code a lot of application code is
done already with certain expectation.

Soren has sent this driver with using -1 for autodetection even at that
time Xilinx gpio driver had 0 there.

This patch is not breaking any current functionality and there is no any
gpio alias in zynq/zynqmp too. And from my point of view the usage of
gpio alias is similar to others aliases present in DTS file.

If you don't want this patch I understand that and it will become just
another soc vendor patch out of mainline.

Thanks,
Michal
