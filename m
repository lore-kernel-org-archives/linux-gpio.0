Ditto my other reply. Our legal team want these lines.

Could do but why bother? For such a trivial function, in my opinion

static void madera_enable_hard_reset(struct madera *madera)
{
	if (madera->reset_gpio)
		gpiod_set_value_cansleep(madera->reset_gpio, 0);
}

is simpler and more readable than

static void madera_enable_hard_reset(struct madera *madera)
{
	if (!madera->reset_gpio)
		return;

	gpiod_set_value_cansleep(madera->reset_gpio, 0);
}

As above, yes it would work the other way but I think for such a simple
implementation the way I have written it is more readable.

Not for a dev_pm_ops that only has runtime pm.
If you're thinking of UNIVERSAL_DEV_PM_OPS that would set the same
functions as handlers for system suspend, which we don't want to do
for the reasons given in the comment describing UNIVERSAL_DEV_PM_OPS.

Seems to be personal preference. Both ways are used in the kernel and
we've always used this style so I'll leave it to Lee to decide.

This is what I mean by code going stale when it's acked but then never
gets merged. Some time ago there was a reason (which I forget).

Are you perhaps thinking the second line is dev_get_drvdata()?
dev_get_platdata() gets a pointer to any pdata, so not related
to dev_set_drvdata().

I can try it and see. It's scary because we can depend on our
children but maybe devm_mfd_add_devices() is safe.

Answered in a comment in another patch. We care about allowing people
to use our chips with systems that don't use devicetree/acpi. There
are also many out-of-tree systems.
