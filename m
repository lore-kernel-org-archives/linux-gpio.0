But the numbers are already in DT, so don't duplicate them in the
source code but just use irq_of_parse_and_map() to get the parent
irq number.

Maybe rename the domain to 'parent_domain' or something like that
to avoid hardcoding any knowledge of the parent IRQ controller being
a GIC. If the same GPIO block gets reused on a PowerPC machine, we
want the driver to just work and not have any ARM specifics in it.
