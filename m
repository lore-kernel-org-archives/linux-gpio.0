Odd, I didn't seem to get any message for this getting applied. Looks
like only a couple lines difference from the version in the regulators
branch, I don't imagine you are able to rebase that with these changes?

Anyway the reason that line needed changed is over a confusion in
what the 'of_node' does in 'struct regulator_config'. The description
seems to make it seem like it is the node that gets checked for
init data.

But the 'of_node' that is actually searched is the one given in
regulator_config->dev->of_node. Is this intended behavior (drivers
assume it is so it probably has to be now) and if so, the above
description might need to be clarified as too what that 'of_node'
pointer really does?
