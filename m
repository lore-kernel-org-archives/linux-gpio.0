Here are some patches that fix gpio hogging for all boards that use
spmi-gpio and ssbi-gpio. These depend on the following two patches
that were merged in 4.20-rc1:

commit 149a96047237 ("pinctrl: qcom: spmi-gpio: fix gpio-hog related
boot issues")

commit 7ed078557738 ("pinctrl: qcom: ssbi-gpio: fix gpio-hog related
boot issues")

I've already fixed pm8941 for the Nexus 5 and that fix is queued to go
into v5.1 during this merge window:

Andy: You may want to consider submitting these post rc1 as a fix for
v5.1 and possibly marking these for stable.
