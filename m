OK so I report this to linux-acpi, HPA and Grant and hope that they
will get them for this "we like port I/O-probing" attitude... there is
only so much we can do.

Basically the (embedded?) x86 vendors need to get
their act together around ACPI just like the ARM vendors did with
device tree.

Only handwaving from my side, sorry... best I can do.
