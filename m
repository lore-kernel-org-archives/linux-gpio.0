The "drivers/input/keyboard/gpio_keys.c" driver used the 'linux,code' property
to get the key type as following in the device-tree file:

gpio-keys {                                       
	compatible = "gpio-keys";

	key-1 {
		gpios = <&gpio5 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		linux,code = <KEY_1>;
		label = "SW2-1";
		wakeup-source;
	};

	key-2 {
		gpios = <&gpio5 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		linux,code = <KEY_2>;
		label = "SW2-2";
		wakeup-source;
	};
};


IMO, extcon-gpio.c uses the 'gpio-connectors' compatible
instead of 'extcon-gpio' and then define the connector type
in the include/dt-bindings/extcon/connectors.h. How about this?

For example,
In the include/dt-bindings/extcon/connectors.h,

#define CONNECTOR_USB		1 /* EXTCON_USB */
#define CONNECTOR_USB_HOST	2 /* EXTCON_USB_HOST */
#define CONNECTOR_CHG_USB_SDP	5 /* EXTCON_CHG_USB_SDP */
#define CONNECTOR_CHG_USB_DCP	6 /* EXTCON_CHG_USB_DCP */
#define CONNECTOR_CHG_USB_CDP	7 /* EXTCON_CHG_USB_CDP */
#define CONNECTOR_CHG_USB_ACA	8 /* EXTCON_CHG_USB_ACA */
...
#define CONNECTOR_HDMI		40 /* EXTCON_DISP_HDMI */
...

In the devicetree example for 'gpio-connectors', 

	usb-connector {
		compatible = "gpio-connectors";
		gpios = <&gpio5 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		linux,connector = <CONNECTOR_USB>;
		wakeup-source;
	};

	hdmi-connector {
		gpios = <&gpio5 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		linux,connector = <CONNECTOR_HDMI>;
		wakeup-source;	
	};
