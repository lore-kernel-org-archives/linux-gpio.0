The wording here is not very clear. I think what you mean is some pins 
are not controlled by any specific driver in the OS, but need to be 
controlled when entering sleep mode.

I don't really like having 2 ways to define pin setup and this doesn't 
scale if I need to define 3 states. Couldn't we create pin state 
definitions and have a pinctrl-n property within the pin controller 
node to handle all the unhandled pins?
