FYI: I asked Stephen if he could find someone else with tech docs to do 
a data review.  This may or may not happen depending on the internal 
interest level and/or current work load.  It will probably take a week 
or so to get sorted out.

Worst case is no extra set of eyes on the data, and as issues are found 
we can fix them in follow up patches.  The driver works for the current 
msm8994 patches submitted by Jeremy.
