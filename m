Hi Linus,

I know it has only been 10 days and you must be busy but I was wondering if we
could get your view on the issue above ?

Since the vast majority of SoC functions need a drive strength setting, DT
patches are somehow blocked until we decide which binding to use for it.

Sorry for this early ping.
