My view of extcon binding is it is fundamentally broken. I've
expressed this multiple times before.

TL;DR: Anything extending the existing extcon binding will be NAKed.

What kind of connector? All connectors external to something... And
GPIO is not a kind of connector on its own, but an implementation.

This doesn't tell me what the GPIOs functions are and should. For
example we have hpd-gpios for HDMI hotplug detect in HDMI connector
binding.

This should be determined by the compatible string.

These don't all look to be mutually exclusive.

For USB PD, isn't that discoverable?

We already have connector bindings for most of these. Use those as a
model for whatever you want to do.
