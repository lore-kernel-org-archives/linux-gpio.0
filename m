Yea, in this case it was a button. I have to look at these drivers. It'=
s
very likely that they cover what I want. But this case is trivial. I
really don't do anything but enabling the IRQ by writing to the edge
attribute and press the push-button connected to that GPIO line.

But as a general note: I think we have quite some customers trying to d=
o
GPIO in userspace. With Zynq's FPGA portion, a lot of things come down
to make signals accessible in Linux and a lot of people do not want or
need a full blown kernel driver and use GPIO. The request for 'how to
handle GPIO IRQs in userspace' is pretty common. Often this gets passed
on to UIO though.

Thanks for the answers.
