Hm, this is nice in some ways but I'm reluctant still.
I really need input from the device tree maintainers on the bindings.

Won't be for v3.14 in any case. Let's get some more input on this
thing.

This is nice.

Add kerneldoc to the following structs as this will be a very generic
driver.

Call it line_bit_offset

And I would add (per comment below) an optional dir_bit_offset
as well.

Should this not be supported by such a generic driver?

Atleast add a big fat TODO comment stating that the next user need to
implement this.

Also struct syscon_gpio_data then should contain an dir_bit_offset
for the direction bits.

Oh you're doing it like that :-)

That is actually helpful. Hm.
