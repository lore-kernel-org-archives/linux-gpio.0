This adds support for the PWM controller in the AO domain.
pinctrl support for GXBB already exists (in both, pinctrl-meson-gxbb.c
and meson-gxbb.dtsi). This patch adds at least the pwm_ao_b pin for
GXL and GXM - these are not documented in Amlogic's kernel, so I had
to borrow the magic numbers from the Khadas VIM kernel (released under
the GPL): [0]

The bits for pwm_AO_a_pins are unknown at the time of writing, but these
can still be added later.

I have successfully tested this on my GXL S905X based Khadas VIM board
with the following .dts snippets (the PWM LED can simply be dimmed
through sysfs):
	&pwm_AO_ab {
		status = "okay";
		pinctrl-0 = <&pwm_ao_b_pins>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		clocks = <&clkc CLKID_FCLK_DIV4>;
		clock-names = "clkin0";
	};

	pwmleds {
		compatible = "pwm-leds";

		power {
			label = "vim:red:power";
			pwms = <&pwm_AO_ab 1 7812500 0>;
			max-brightness = <255>;
		};
	};

(if anyone is interested in more of my Khadas VIM patches - these are
still work-in-progress, which is why I have not sent them yet - can
take a look at this: [1])

NOTE: The .dts changes from this series are based on top of my SAR ADC
patches.
