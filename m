This appears to be solving another possible problem/feature with pin
controllers during suspend, which is not exactly what I am after here.

Unless we generalize this into a state of some kind, which would
de-facto force a state transition in pinctrl_select_state() because
p->default != state, then I am not sure this how that is related to the
problem space exposed earlier.
