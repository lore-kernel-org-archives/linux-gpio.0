Right. I think that translation function could be done with DT though.
For example, we could remap an ACTIVE_LOW flag to an ACTIVE_HIGH flag,
by matching the GPIO on active low and changing it to active high during
the remap. That seems like something we can solve now if it ever happens
by keeping the remapping scheme that interrupts does. Of course, if it
becomes more complicated this breaks down, but then we can always have
the connector driver do the more complicated stuff.

If we want to support pass through, perhaps we should introduce yet
another property to indicate which cells and maybe even which bits in
those cells should be passed through from one side to the other. That
way we can support a compressed scheme without requiring all the
combinations of gpios and flags to be listed out.

For example, gpio-map-pass-thru = <0x0 0xff> would mean that we should
pass through the second cell values that are the lower 8 bits. Map
matching would still be done with the map-mask property, but this
property would indicate which part of the specifier to mask out of the
other side when copying it over.

Right I think that should work but I haven't tested it so far.
Unfortunately, interrupt mapping doesn't have pass through support, so
we may want to add the same pass through mask property there and update
the interrupt mapping code too? I was trying to figure out how to make
the interrupt code and this function the same, but the whole
interrupt-parent scan made it feel unwieldy to the point where I gave
up.

I thought about that. I was worried that we wanted to support this API
being called in atomic context, but that seems like it can't possibly be
the case. So I'll have to allocate a string for each of those and free
them on exit. Should be ok.
