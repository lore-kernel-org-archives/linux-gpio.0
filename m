See Documentation/gpio/consumer.txt and Documentation/gpio/board.txt.
You can obtain a GPIO descriptor without using a number by calling
gpiod_get(). Prior to that, individual GPIOs need to be bound to
devices and functions using either DT (preferred) or the platform
interface. The old integer-based GPIO interface is considered
deprecated, although still widely used. But new code should rely
exclusively on gpiod, and we encourage people to convert existing code
to it too.

Yeah, I know that's not ideal. As a workaround, users can maybe
identify the right gpiochip by parsing /sys/class/gpio/gpiochip* and
comparing the "label" node. Once the right chip is found, its "base"
entry gives the base GPIO number which can be used to export the
desired GPIO.

We are also taking steps to come with a better sysfs interface. I will
keep you in the loop.

Yeah, besides this property did not receive a warm reception. So my
suggestion for now is to workaround the issue using the technique
described above, until we come with a better sysfs interface that does
not rely on GPIO numbers. Sorry for that inconvenience.
