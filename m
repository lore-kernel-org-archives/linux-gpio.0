Yes we just reapply the state, I guess the important thing here
is we arn't doing that through pinctrl we are just returning
the registers to the appropriate values (which regmap handily
provides) as part of resume.

It looks like there are other pinctrl drivers also doing this,
although often hardcoding it rather than using regmap. See either
pinctrl-exynos-arm.c or pinctrl-at91-pio4.c

See that's the bit that is concerning me, shouldn't the default
position be you get your pin state reconfigured during resume,
without having to do anything. Anything else seems to violate the
principle of least surprise.

It also feels to me the provider driver should be handling that,
rather than expecting the consumer to call pinctrl_select_state
again. So for example from the consumer I should be fine just to
call pinctrl_select_state in probe and have that state remain
until someone changes it.

Thanks,
