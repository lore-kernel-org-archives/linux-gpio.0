Ok. This patch-set is to make this driver more generic so that all future SoCs , as you mentioned like NS2, NSP, Stingray, could use it.  Since This Cygnus is in very very early stage and No customer is using it so we can afford it to address ngpio from DT and remove Cygnus hard coded values immediately from this patch. Otherwise we will see the same issue with "gpios-ranges" property and this will be highly inter-dependent as well.

Pramod
