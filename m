feilds -> fields

Do you mean "bitfields", i.e a few bits inside a configuration register
word?

Actually I do not understand at all what "domain pad driving level"
or "system control select" means, those are very generic terms.
Can you describe precisely what it means? What domain? What
is a domain pad? What kind of system control? What is it selecting
between?

OK

configurate -> configure

OK that is pin configuration.

Do not talk about the driver in the bindings. Talk about the bindings per
se, these bindings are supposed to be OS neutral.

Do not use the custom property "sprd,pins" for this, if you want to set up pin
muxing with a magic value use the generic binding "pinmux", see:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt?id=8d5e7c5df0a6c442373628be5221321172b1badf

But consider using groups+functions for defining multiplexing instead.

But please do NOT combine pin configuration into a magic value. Use
the generic pin control bindings, er have bindings for all kinds of pin
config, and using them makes the driver much more readable for
humans.

I understand that you may have a lot of magic number tables around that
you are using today, but it is necessary to decompose that into the proper
generic pin configuration properties to make it usable.

Same comments.

Magic numbers are very hard to understand. Compare to this
from Qualcomm APQ8064 using just standard bindings:

pinmux@800000 {
        i2c4_pins: i2c4_pinmux {
               pins = "gpio12", "gpio13";
               function = "gsbi4";
               bias-disable;
        };

        spi_pins: spi_pins {
               mux {
                      pins = "gpio18", "gpio19", "gpio21";
                      function = "gsbi5";
                      drive-strength = <10>;
                      bias-none;
                };
        };
};

Please try go get rid of the magic numbers and get to use pins, function,
drive-strength bias etc from the standard bindings. We also have a lot
of helper code available to use this.
