I don't see this as an "issue" to be quite honest. By saying that, I at
least agree with you that these are not information that's mandatory to
be in the driver given what we already have. MODULE_LICENSE is covered
by license header. MODULE_DESCRIPTION is covered by descriptions in
Kconfig. MODULE_AUTHOR is much less important than what's in the
MAINTAINERS list.

Since I have to submit a new patch series to address the "ngpios" issue
that Linus mentioned in the other email, I don't mind removing all these
MODULE_* macros in the driver all together.
