Hi Linus,

thanks for having a look!

Ah, thanks for the pointer, will try to see if that fits in here.
Although here (despite my clumsy naming) I think this is more about the
"pinmux" pins than the GPIOs. I am not sure if it's just my
understanding or if on Allwinner we just happen to have every pinmux pin
being a GPIO pin as well, so the distinction between the two isn't so clear.

Which makes it a bit more confusing because we have the pinctrl and GPIO
controller drivers combined in one file.

Thanks for the hint, will have a look.

I agree, this allwinner prefix was just a first shot for the RFC.

The reason for this map is that older Allwinner SoCs have *one* IRQ pin
bank, which contains pins from *multiple* GPIO banks. The A10/A20 for
instance maps the first 22 IRQ pins to Port H0-H21, the remaining 10 IRQ
pins are on port I10-I19. This irq-pin-map is an admittedly
over-engineered attempt to express this is a generic way, trying to
embrace the DT way of mapping things, like we do with the "ranges"
property, for instance.

Recent SoCs just have some GPIO banks which map directly to IRQ pin
banks (on the A64 ports B, G and H map to IRQ bank 0, 1 and 2), so this
is not really needed here. My first version indeed just had a simpler
list to express this.

This series aims to build on top of the existing driver as much as
possible, so some things are not as elegant as they could be.

It is indeed hacky, and just maps the irq_bank_base member of struct
sunxi_pinctrl_desc into the DT. My understanding is that the A33 skips
the first interrupt bank in the register map, for whatever reason. Might
just be an implementation oddity.
I am just wondering if this could be expressed with the irq-pin-map
above. Or if it's more or less an A33 bug, we could derive this from the
compatible string.

Right, should mention that.

I can understand that, and that's why I choose the new binding to just
be an extension of what we have already.

I am happy to have a discussion on that in general - actually this was
one aim of this series. See the other thread.

I might even write some summary on how it works today and why I believe
it should be improved, I just wasn't sure that was actually needed.

Cheers,
Andre.
