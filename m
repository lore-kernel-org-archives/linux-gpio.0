It looks correct to me.

I haven't verified it, but I think the OF device-tree probing code for 
the platform devices will automatically xlat-and-map all those irqs, so 
that the  irq_domain_push_irq() is required to get the domain hierarchy 
properly configured.  It would be similar to the PCI case where we 
configure all the MSI-X and then do the irq_domain_push_irq() in the 
Cavium ThunderX driver.

If interrupt handling has been verified to work with this driver, I 
would say that we are probably using things "the right way".

David.
