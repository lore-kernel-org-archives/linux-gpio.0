I know, and that's what my patches do.  I tell gpiolib that I need a 
valid mask:

/* If the GPIO map is sparse, then we need to disable specific IRQs */
chip->irq_need_valid_mask = pctrl->soc->sparse;

Then I proceed to provide the specific GPIOs that exist, one block at a 
time:

	ret = gpiochip_add_pin_range(&pctrl->chip,
				     dev_name(pctrl->dev),
				     start, start, count);

That's true.  I set it to the maximum number of GPIOs that exist on the 
chip.  I could set it to the highest number of GPIOs that I register 
(e.g. the highest value of "start + count"), but that's not necessary 
for my patches to work.

That's what I'm doing.

It appear we're re-hashing that same exact argument.

I guess great minds do think alike!

I agree.

In my case, the ACPI table provides an exact list that I use at probe() 
time.

True, but /sys/kernel/debug/gpio is the only mechanism I found where the 
user can get a list of valid GPIOs.  Maybe we need something similar in 
/sys/class/gpio/.
