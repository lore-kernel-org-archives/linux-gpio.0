If each bank has a unique physical address, it should be a
unique device with a compatible string.

Below: rethink this. All are named gpio-* which is the generic
GPIO namespace and should be documented in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt
so figure out if what you're adding is generic or not.

The node name is unique enough and is what we use in device
trees. Get rid of this.

Looks like it should be nxp,no-output-state

Explain more. I think this should probably be generic and
described together with ngpios.

Use the generic ngpios, also one does not exclude the other, e.g
if there is 32 gpios, offset it 8 ngpios is 8, we know that
bits 8..15 are GPIO lines.

This is really hopeless to understand. This document needs a
detailed description about how this GPIO block works so we
have the background for this.

You need to add a description of how the block maps IRQs
to GPIO lines. It seems like it is doing some kind of
phone-exchange type of thing and just latches the GPIO line
out to an IRQ line on the interrupt controller, and that is
why even setting up trigger type has to percolate up to
the parent? Explain this in this document.

You forgot to documen this property.
