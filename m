the hardware here is the same, the driver is different.

With the existing LPC32xx DTS files I tested that the DTS GPIO client's
interface is unchanged and that GPIO client drivers correctly work with
the new GPIO controller driver.

As a summary about the change,
* DT binding of GPIO controller in lpc32xx.dtsi is extended (no removed
properties),
* client's DT binding to the GPIO controller are untouched,
* GPIO controller code is completely replaced,
* GPIO client's side is untouched.

As a reminder about the necessity of the change, the legacy driver
operates with hardware IRQs, this prevents switching of the platfrom to
SPARSE_IRQ model.

It is important that the change depends on IRQ chip driver, which is
also under review.

I would appreciate, if review of this change can be started, so that
both IRQ chip driver and GPIO controller driver are accepted in one
merge window.
