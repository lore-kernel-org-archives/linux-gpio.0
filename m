OK, though that requires a struct device references, so while I could
certainly resolve the device_node -> struct device that corresponds to
the GPIO provider , that poses a number of issues:

- not all struct device_node have a corresponding struct device
reference (e.g: clock providers, interrupt controllers, and possibly
other custom drivers), though in this case, they most likely do have one

- resolving a struct device associated with a struct device_node is
often done in a "bus" specific way, e.g: of_find_device_by_node(), so if
the GPIO provider is e.g: i2c_device, pci_device etc. etc. this might
not work that easily

I think this is what Dmitry just indicated in his email as well.

The issue exists with shutdown (through the use of "poweroff"), that is
confirmed, but I cannot see how it does not exist with any suspend state
as well, for the same reason that the ordering is not strictly enforced.
