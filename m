It's a doc problem.
Latest RM seems got updated.

As here it's a reference definition in binding doc and device tree actually=
 does not
use it (IMX Pinctrl use raw data to set pad configuration). So it won't cau=
se any
compatibility issue to me.

Please update the patch title to:
dt-bindings: pinctrl: imx7d: xxxxx

Otherwise:
