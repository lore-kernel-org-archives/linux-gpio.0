So you are relying on the core code in gpiolib to select a linear
map. That is implicit semantics, and either all drivers using
GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP should be changed to irq_linear_revmap()
or all stay with irq_find_mapping().

In this case, I doubt it that you are actually so timing critical that
it matters. Please use irq_find_mapping().

Ah, I get it. Nice.

Ooops, yeah handle_edge_irq() is what calls the ACK callback.

What you're doing is mocking around with core irqchip semantics.
Is ->mask really supposed to be played around with from the outsid
like this?

Anyways: BIT(i % GPIO_PER_REG) is nicer.

It has irq_create_mapping(gpiochip->irqdomain, offset); that get
called for every IRQ, and that will eventually call irq_of_parse_and_map()
if the IRQs are defined in the device tree. (IIRC)
