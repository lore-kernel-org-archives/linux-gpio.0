Nothing's wrong with the generic device callbacks/notifiers, but in some
cases we don't want a generic driver to handle board specificities.

This is the case for the at91rm9200ek board (see this thread:
https://www.mail-archive.com/devicetree-u79uwXL29TY76Z2rM5mHXA@public.gmane.org/msg06838.html).

Since we are moving all boards to dt, we can't configure each board at
startup, and the rm9200ek board used to set a pin to a specific value 
(this pin
is connected to an external switch which connects MMC signals to the MMC
connector or SPI signals to an SPI device depending on the pin value) in 
order
to enable the MMC0 port or an SPI device.

I first proposed to handle this using a pinctrl pinconf definition (with 
pinctrl
output-high config). As pinctrl are requesting pinconf before calling 
driver probe
function, this was absolutely transparent to the generic driver.
But, as Linus pointed out, this pin is not really related to the SPI or 
MMC device
itself.
This is why Linus suggested the GPIO hog approach.

Anyway, I'm open to any other solution that wouldn't introduce specific
cases in arch specific code or generic drivers.

Best Regards,

Boris
