$DEITY no :)

I mean instead of having the gpio hog in the gpio adapter driver, have
a gpio-hog driver, that=E2=80=99s using an undisclosed method to make s=
ure that
it=E2=80=99s the first one to be probed afterwards.

We can probably do it using DT.

Or maybe using the proposed gpio hog method doesn=E2=80=99t cover every=
 case.

I don=E2=80=99t know, that=E2=80=99s why we=E2=80=99re spending time ta=
lking about this :)
