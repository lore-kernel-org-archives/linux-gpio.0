I can't say it won't work, it could work in some cases. My fear is to
have some support cases because of this. It seems easy to spot this kind
of issue but experience tell us that we can loose time for this kind of
"stupid" error.

It validates the decision to not put group declaration in the
driver. If we put all the configurations, it will add a big amount of
code. If we put only the configurations we use, the user will have to
compile a new kernel to add the ones he needs.

Well, maybe you're right about putting the groups in the dts files. I've
to think more about this solution.

Yes, I can still use it. What I mean is there is no generic helper at the
moment to get both pinmux (excepting using the function property) and
pinconf information. Is it planned to have something generic for the
pinmux property? I see MTK_GET_PIN_NO and MTK_GET_PIN_FUNC macros, on my side,
I think it will feet my needs. Maybe we only need to remove the MTK
prefix and put these macros in another header.

In the mediatek driver, I have also noticed that we have a group for
each pin. I have the feeling that the concept of groups disappear, isn't
it?
