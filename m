Linus,

What is your opinion of the i.MX6 pinctrl failure after my bugfix patch
for the hogs?
If you would want to revert my patch I would need to change this pinctrl
driver so it has its own child node as a workaround to the hog bug.

Or do you think it is more likely a bug in the i.MX6 pinctrl driver?
