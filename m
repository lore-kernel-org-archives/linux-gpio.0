Sorry for chiming in late. I tested your driver on the Sockit and the GPIOs
work fine (basically just tested the 4 HPS LEDS that are on this board).

With the interrupt support I had a little trouble though:
The Sockit has an ADXL345 on the i2c bus with a gpio as interrupt line.

First: When you use "interrupt-parent", you have to specify the gpio node,
rather than the gpio-bank that has the interrupt-controller property. Is
that expected? I'm not really sure if that is normal behavior...

Second: The interrupt is registered as "GIC 37", which is a real interrupt on
the Socfpga. I would expect it to be marked as "GPIO 2xx" (or something in that
range). The interrupt from the gpiochip itself isn't registered at all ?!

Third: The interrupt didn't work. But that might also be my failure. I guess/hope
you tested interrupts successfully?!

(Fourth: small typo in the documentation example: "snps,nr-gpio" instead of "snps,nr-gpios")

Regards,
Steffen
