OK I have forwarded this post to Laurent Pinchart who wrote the
shmobile pin control implementation
so we can reach some clarity on how this is supposed to work.

Let's figure this out.

I cannot really say very much about the legacy stuff as I have no clue how that
works. Paul Mundt and Magnus Damm may know.

So this is what we need to discuss with Laurent.

"Manually" is a very strange word that we use from time to time with a
very fuzzy semantic meaning.

I start to think about Charlie Chaplin in the factory in "modern times"
when I hear this word.

I guess what you mean is that pulls can always be controlled, no matter
if the GPIO block is in use or not, so it corresponds to the diagram above.

This is *one* way to do it that some implementers have opted for.
The other way is to implement the .gpio_request_enable(),
.gpio_disable_free() functions in struct pinmux_ops so as to
shortcut and simplify matters.

Either way works.

Controlling GPIO through pinconf seems to be very twisted.
Usually it is the other way around.

When  a GPIO driver is using pin control as back-end it calls
specific helpers from <linux/pinctrl/consumer.h>:

pinctrl_request_gpio()
pinctrl_free_gpio()
pinctrl_gpio_direction_input()
pinctrl_gpio_direction_output()

Nominally the pin config and GPIO portions are treated ortogonally,
and the four calls above take care of the interaction between the
two systems.

Note that it is perfectly legal for a pin to be used by
the pin control and GPIO subsystems simultaneously:
e.g. a pin control hog can set up a bias and then the
GPIO subsystem can drive that pin without any
cross-talk.

Yes this makes perfect sense. I would sat the first (bias)
parameter should be handled by the pin control subsystem.

The latter setting should be controlled by the GPIO subsystem
only, right? Because BIAS_HIGH_IMPEDANCE is usually
the same as input. Maybe you want this to happen inside
of the pin control driver as a result of the GPIO driver
calling pinctrl_gpio_direction_input() or
pinctrl_gpio_direction_output(), that is up to the
implementation but it is one way to do it, Laurent can
comment on this I guess.

This looks messy. The intention with the pin config subsystem
is to break things apart and make them understandable that
way, and to handle electronic stuff in pin config whereas driving
a line high/low happens in the GPIO subsystem.

It's the divide-and-conquer design pattern if you like.

> And once you have the answer to that, what about glitch-free handover?

Usually this is a matter for the device driver, for example you can
find interesting glitch workarounds in drivers/pinctrl-nomadik.c.

If you need help from the subsystem to do this let's see what is
needed.

This must be some misunderstanding. DT does not specify
application/ordering semantics. It does not define sequences at
all. The device driver parsing out whatever is in the device tree
has to take care of ordering stuff and driving the hardware.

On all of these problems we need Laurent's input I think.
