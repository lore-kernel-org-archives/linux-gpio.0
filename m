The concrete use-case is that I have two boards with same I/O on them, but they use
two different SoC. And I like to shadow it to users. On one board is some I/O on
pioC16 and on the other it is on pioA30 for example.
I'd like to prepare I/O just with right board names for example in11.
I'm trying to do something like GPIOs LEDs, I like that interface, but I need it
for both direction.
So where else give the name then in DT. And why not to export it there. Just like
LEDs.
Of course I can use gpio_export_with_link() to not change gpio_export().
But what I don't like on gpio_export_with_link() is that there will be twice more
dirs in sysfs and it would be less transparent and users confusing "What is the pioA30?"
