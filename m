Yes, I'm sure.  The regulators are just properties on the device, they
are not devices themselves.

No, well implemented older drivers will still unconditionally register
everything.

For the reasons I've outlined repeatedly.

No, you are missing the point.  The point is that only regulators
explicitly listed in the DT will be instantiated.

You're talking about a trivial loop that takes perhaps a couple of lines
to open and close the for loop and another line to declare an iterator
variable.

Look, please stop arguing about this.  There appears to be nothing
special about this device that makes it different to other devices.

This sounds exactly the same as the majority of PMIC drivers, there is
nothing remarkable here.

No, this would be broken - devices are instantiated via the driver
model.
