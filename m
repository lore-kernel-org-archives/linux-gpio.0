Unfortunately this seems to be one of these hacks for
hierarchical interrupts that does not quite cut it.

This works as long as consuming drivers pick a GPIO first
using gpiod_get() (and variants) and then convert it to an
IRQ using gpiod_to_irq().

But it doesn't work when some consumer is just picking an
IRQ off of the node without picking the GPIO first.
And in DT that is OK, this DT node is definately an interrupt
controller. (Leaving out the attribute for interrupt controller
as is currently the case doesn't really fix the issue, it is
just inconsistent.)

Look at Brian Masney's series for the qualcomm pin controller
chips for inspiration on how to do things right, see:
commit 9d2b563bc23acfa93e7716b3396fd2f79fa8f0cd
and down.

Especially note how he removes the kind of hack you are
adding in e.g.
commit a796fab2c605d6340512c51c6c3fa1c581357993
