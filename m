 ==============
 
-The required properties of child nodes are (as defined in pinctrl-bindings):
-- function
-- groups
+The required properties of pinmux child nodes are:
+- function: the mux function to select
+- groups  : the list of groups to select with this function
 
-Each function has only one associated pin group. Each group is named by its
-function. The following values for the function and groups properties are

+Required properties of pinconf child nodes are:
+- groups: A list of groups to select (either this or "pins" must be
+          specified)
+- pins  : A list of ball names as strings, eg "D14" (either this or "groups"
+          must be specified)
+
+Optional properties of pinconf child nodes are:
+- bias-disable  : disable any pin bias
+- bias-pull-down: pull down the pin
+- drive-strength: sink or source at most X mA

+Definitions are as specified in
