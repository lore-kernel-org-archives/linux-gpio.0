I think the common case is something more like this:

                 gpio-map = <0 0 &soc_gpio1 1 0>,
                            <1 0 &soc_gpio2 4 0>,
                            <2 0 &soc_gpio1 3 0>,
                            <3 0 &soc_gpio2 2 0>;
                 gpio-map-mask = <0xf 0>;

where we want to pass the 2nd cell of the consumer (e.g. reset-gpios)
thru. So here the GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW flag below needs to pass thru to
&soc_gpio1. Otherwise, the gpio-map is has to enumerate every possible
combination or it will be specific to the daughterboard's usage.

Also, GPIO cells are pretty well standardized, but some cases may need
a translation function which I guess would be part of a connector
driver. I don't think that affects the binding nor needs to be solved
now, but just want to raise that possibility.

GPIOs also are interrupts frequently, so we need to make sure
interrupt translation works too. It's a bit tricky as interrupt-map
depends on #address-cells and #interrupt-cells. I think we just set
the #address-cells to 0 on the connector node and it will be fine. We
may need the same pass thru of flags though.

Perhaps these 3 could be just a single base name (e.g. "gpio")?
Doesn't really buy much other than enforce we don't mix 'gpios' and
'gpio'. That could never happen. ;)
