Are we sure matching on node names is a good idea? Most are just arbitrary
names meant to be human readable and reference-able, giving them function
may lead to confusion. This seems to be why we have "compatible", for specific
identification of node function. But I'm new so maybe I'm wrong?

This is already the case then, missing regulator nodes in old drivers will not
get instantiated ether. And old drivers don't always store any more info about
available regulators than mine does.

Sure, but then we have to do some fiddling with MFD_CORE to do that work,
why not remove the dependency and let DT do that for DT only drivers?

We are not adding anything extra to the DT node, we just use the "compatible"
string to identify and match the node vs. "regulator-name", or the nodes name,
or whatever else has been used. The node is then just filled with the standard
optional properties just like every other driver's node.

Newer than a lot, I chose to base my driver off of that not just because
it is a similar TI part, but because it was the cleanest, simplest looking
one IMHO. The helpers would require more code (you need to know how many
regulators you have and call the helpers in a loop).

I have another PMIC I'm about to push a driver for when this gets figured out
that does the same thing, and it's more important I think to do it this way for
this new part. Some of the new regulators are designed without a dedicated
SOC or board to power in mind, so they will have a whole bunch for different
regulator types on one chip and it will be up to the designer to pick which ones
to turn on and use. With this DT approach you can just list the ones you want,
and we may even be able to split different types into different modules, then
we can use the same regulator driver in different spins of the PMIC with more
or less of that type of regulator, we just add that same node under a different
parent PMIC driver.

I could use the helper with this style and save a couple lines of code if we
could make regulator_of_get_init_data to also match on "compatible", it
currently only matches on "regulator-compatible" or the node name. I could make
this addition and send the patch if you would like to see what I have in mind.
