Yes we understood that, and in the process you are bypassing the eg ACPI
power management model completely, but since all you are after is using
the Linux pinctrl kernel driver with ACPI _today_ without going through
the ASWG (and without booting with a device tree instead of ACPI) and
define a specification that has a chance to co-exist with the ACPI power
management model this proposal is the end result, it is a shortcut fraught
with problems.

If you know that there are some discussions please take place in those
discussions and work towards a solution that takes into account
other parts of ACPI specifications that can be affected, it may
take longer to get you there but that's true for everyone who
wants to contribute to ACPI specifications I am afraid.

Thank you,
