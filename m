Sorry if my description was unclear.

I do not think IRQ_NOREQUEST is equivalent
to IRQ_DOMAIN_FLAG_NO_CREATE I am trying to add in 5/6.


My intention is to prevent platform_get_irq()
from allocating a new virq.

I think IRQ_NOREQUEST only affects request_irq().



Having said that, this series got negative response
as a whole.

My motivation is to get my GPIO driver (6/6) in
by hook or by crook.
If you do not like this series, please feel free to throw it away.
