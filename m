That did the trick.

Well as you say DT doesn't care for technology nor manufacturer. I'd go for
dropping the manufacturer and adding an "x" for the technology (i.e. 74x595).
I saw that the binding is being used on some boards is there any rule against
changing bindings that are already being used?

I'll happily do a new version of the patch if the idea is worth it.
