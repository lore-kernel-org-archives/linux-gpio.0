Understandable :)

To avoid any confusion, please bear with me and clarify this once and 
for all,
since I'm not certain I fully got you here.

Are you suggesting:

1) Use "pins" property with the currently implemented ABI (which 
slightly differs
    from the standard documented one as explained above. Not sure it is 
fine overriding
    it or not)

2) Use "pins" property and change our ABI to match the documented one: 
one ID (integer
    or string) per pin, not 2 as we're doing now.

Both solutions are easily implementable; 2) requires some more work to 
make pin id, function number
and pin configuration fit in one single integer, but is achievable for 
sure.

Thanks
