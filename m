Hi Michal,

thanks for your input!

Not really. At the moment uart0 is used to lookup the (hard-coded) table
entry for pins PB22 and PB23, which returns the said value of 0x02 (in
this example, cf. line 246 in pinctrl-sun7i-a20.c).
But if there are other pins where UART0 can be muxed too, there is
another node describing them (cf. uart3_pins_a and uart3_pins_b in
sun7i-a20.dtsi). This one uses the "uart0" name as well, but the muxval
returned for _those pins_ can be different. So the string only makes
sense in connection with a certain pin.

How would you mux them if they are not in the table?

Kind of, but not if we want to keep compatibility with older and newer
DTs and older and newer kernels (drivers, really) - which is my goal.
So we just _add_ the muxval values. The existing chip-specific drivers
would naturally ignore the values and just use their built-in table for
lookup. The generic driver on the other hand would use the DT
information. An appropriate compatible string could then be added to
refer to the generic driver as a fallback.
For (future) SoCs (which would not have a specific driver) we could omit
the function string (if this isn't needed elsewhere, I have to check).
So I don't see how the redundancy would be an issue here.

But it removes the requirement of relying on the built-in lookup table.
So by using a more readable uart0 "mnemonic" we rely on some hardcoded,
chip specific table in each kernel, which is just wrong IMHO. Other DT
users (be it Xen or *BSD, for instance) would have to replicate this
table and since it's really SoC specific, it does not make any sense to
me to keep it separate. After all this DT node is SoC specific as well,
so I don't see the point of abstracting this with some string lookup.

So to stay with your comparison: Yes, we move from assembly to machine
code, but we get rid of the need for a SoC specific assembler, which is
maintained separately.

Why is that? We have the actual pin tables in the shared SoC DT, each
board specific DT just refers to the actually connected pins by
reference. That wouldn't change at all. So the above example for
instance is from sun7i-a20.dtsi, board specific .dts files just use:
pinctrl-0 = <&uart0_pins_a>;

I don't get this. Having the actual values instead of a string lookup
would make it actually easier to lookup for more light-weight kernels.

That doesn't sound to tempting to me.

So I guess I just failed to express my approach properly.
I will try to code a proof of concept this week and convert once SoC
over to the new driver, maybe this clears things up.

If I have a blatant misunderstanding of the concepts (quite possible),
please keep correcting me!

Thanks!
Andre.
