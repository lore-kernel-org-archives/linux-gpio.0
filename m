 This works for machines covered by case ii) in Section 2. Once the driver
 received a notification, it will set the backlight level accordingly. This does
 not affect the sending of event to user space, they are always sent to user
 space regardless of whether or not the video module controls the backlight level
 directly. This behaviour can be controlled through the brightness_switch_enabled
