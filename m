It is a correct regulator here, but i have to admit that it's a bit confusing.
Here the regulator is an abstract regulator which is actually used to
control CAN
transceiver STBY signals, it is introduced by below patch:
commit b7c4114b07bbacfe0aee1d04ad1ade9e42309620

    can: flexcan: Use a regulator to control the CAN transceiver

    Instead of using a GPIO to turn on/off the CAN transceiver, it is better to
    use a regulator as some systems may use a PMIC to power the CAN transceiver.

Besides the unproperly handling control signals, this solution also can't handle
multiple CAN transceiver control signals ways.

I was trying to write a common transceiver driver to handling this issue.
But get interrupted by a few other FSL official works, will resume soon.

I would suggest keep the regulator first until the new solution got in.
