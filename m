Sometimes it is desirable to define a "safe" configuration for a GPIO in
the device tree but let the operating system later still make use of
this pin.

This might for example be useful to initially configure a debug pin that
is usually unconnected as output to prevent floating until it is used
later.

Hello,

this picks up a discussion that pops up now and then with our customers.

Last time I discussed this topic with Linus Walleij my suggestion was to
merge this usecase with gpio-hogs, but he wasn't happy with it because
hogging implies that the pin is not free for other usage and he
suggested to use "gpio-init" instead.

Maybe it's arguable if this "initial configuration" belongs into the
device tree, but IMHO defining a "safe configuration" should have a
place and the requirements are identical. This isn't implied by the name
however, but I don't have a better idea for a different name.

Thinking further (which was also discussed last time) it would also be
nice to restrict usage. For example that a given pin that has
"output-low" as its safe setting might be configured later als high
output but not as input. Maybe:

	companion-reset {
		gpio-somethingwithsafe;
		gpios = <12 0>;
		output-low;
		fixed-direction;
	};

(Conceptually we would have a hog then when also adding "fixed-value".)

I'm not sure the early configuration should be implemented in Linux. I'd
target the bootloader for that instead, still having the blessing of a
binding document would be great.

I look forward to your comments and ideas.

Best regards
Uwe
