So let me understand this right.

For something input-only, return -EINVAL from .direction_output()
and vice versa mutatis mutandis for something output-only.

This semantic is set at runtime when using these functions.

Why can't you do this in the specific driver? Why does that have
to be handled by the core? I mean of course we can add a
flag to the gpio_desc if you think it's gonna be a common case,
but then I want an indication that there is a bunch of drivers that
need this done in the core.

I disagree and the DT maintainer Rob Herring already said he kind
of dislikes the hogs already, so let's not expand their use beyond
what is already being done, which is explicit hogging.

IMO this breaks Rusty Russell's API Design Manifesto,
levels 7 and 6:

7. The obvious use is (probably) the correct one.
6. The name tells you how to use it.

In my case, just no. It is not obvuous and does not tell me how
to use it.

Something like gpio-line-initial-directions, gpio-line-initial-values
etc does.

I disagree with that, sorry.

But let's ask for more opinions.

This looks OK to me.

Those are OK with me but I guess with

fixed-direction-output;
fixed-direction-input;

I still don't really understand the fixed-direction thing.

If that is a property of the *hardware* it should not be in the
device tree IMO. It should be in the driver and derived from
the compatible string.

If that is a property of the *use case* in *this system*
then something like this makes sense: we may need to
restrict it further for electrical reasons, that is nice.

I think you will have a problem with Rob on this though, he's not
a big fan of these hogging nodes and I'm not sure he's gonna like
the gpio-init nodes much.

If you send some patch, make sure to get it ACKed by Rob.

Yours,
