I think the scheme will fail if you ever get gpio controllers that are
not part of the DT: We have hotpluggable devices (PCI, USB, ...) that
are not represented in DT and that may also provide GPIOs for internal
uses.

The current state of affairs is definitely problematic, but defining
the GPIO numbers in DT properties would only be a relative improvement,
not a solution, and I fear it would make it harder to change the kernel
to remove the gpio numbers eventually.

I wonder if we could instead come up with an approach that completely
randomizes the gpio numbers (as a compile-time option) to find any
places that still rely on specific numbers.
