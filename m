Well the fact that .to_irq() is called does not mean that you know
it will be used as an interrupt either. Sorry. It is just a translation
function, not an allocation function.

Nice ASCII art, include that into the commit message :)

Well now I am even *more* convinced that this should not happen in
.to_irq(). .to_irq() should not do *anything*.

This needs to happen as part of the irqchip setting up the actual
interrupt.

And it seems the problem is that this driver does *not* define its
own irqchip, but it *should*.

What you want to do is implement an hierarchical irqdomain in your
irqchip, which is what other drivers of this type are doing, see:
drivers/gpio/gpio-xgene-sb.c
irq_domain_create_hierarchy() is your friend.

This is a textbook example of a hierarchichal irq domain I think.

That is what hierarchical irqdomain is for.

You should expose an irqchip from the gpio driver, that give you
unique irq translations for *all* GPIO lines.

Then, at runtime, if the hierarchical irqdomain cannot map
(i.e. mux) the interrupt onto one of the available lines,
you will get an error.
