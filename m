This causes some unfortunate confusion wrt internal linux naming.

GPIO lines have two "names"

- The "name" is what the line (pin) is named
  on the chip, or the name of the rail going out on the board, from the chip,
  so it is a producer name.

- Then the GPIO consumers set a second name, called "label"
  (confusingly) so we can see in e.g. debugfs and now also the userspace
  ABI who is using it.

I named these "name" and "consumer" in the userspace ABI, I think
I should take a round and rename it from "label" to "consumer"
also inside the kernel to avoid confusion with this, because "label"
in DT is going to be converted to "name" in the GPIOlib and
then it also has something named "label" and that is another thing,
argh!

Yours,
