1 would mean a semantic change.

For all GPIO I checked in upstream device trees we assign a pinctrl to
the same node, so in all cases gpio_request_enable/disable is really
unnecessary.

And since the current implementation has adversarial effects for I2C
recovery (https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9351401/), we use the
orthogonal semantic in the closely related i.MX SoCs and it even
simplifies the driver, I am ok to change the semantic.

Can you prepare such a patchset so that we can further test that on
Vybrid?
