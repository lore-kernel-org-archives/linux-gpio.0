+* Spreadtrum Pin Controller
+
+The Spreadtrum pin controller are organized in 3 blocks (types).
+
+The first block comprises some global control registers, and each
+register contains several feilds with one bit or several bits to
+configurate for some global common configuration, such as domain
+pad driving level, system control select and so on. We recognise
+every feild comprising one bit or several bits in one global control
+register as one pin, thus we should record every pin's bit offset,
+bit width and register offset to configurate this feild (pin).
+
+The second block comprises some common registers which have unified
+register definition, and each register described one pin is used
+to configurate pin sleep mode and function select.
+
+The last block comprises some misc registers which also have unified
+register definition, and each register described one pin is used to
+configurate drive strength, pull up/down and so on.
+
+This driver supports the generic pin multiplexing and configuration
+bindings. For details on each properties, you can refer to
+./pinctrl-bindings.txt.
+
+Required properties for Spreadtrum pin controller:
+- compatible: "sprd,<soc>-pinctrl"
+  Please refer to each sprd,<soc>-pinctrl.txt binding doc for supported SoCs.
+
+Required properties for pin configuration node:
+- sprd,pins: each entry consists of 2 integers and represents the pin
+  id and config setting for one pin.

+* Spreadtrum SC9860 Pin Controller
+
+Please refer to sprd,pinctrl.txt in this directory for common binding part
+and usage.
+
+Required properties:
+- compatible: must be "sprd,sc9860-pinctrl".
+- reg: the register address of pin controller device.
+- sprd,pins: two integers array, represents a group of pins id and config
+  setting. The format is sprd,pins = <PIN_ID CONFIG>, PIN_ID can be found
+  from pinctrl-sprd-sc9860.c file or spec file, CONFIG is the pad setting
+  value like pull-up for this pin.
+
+Example:
+pin_controller: pinctrl@402a0000 {
+	compatible = "sprd,sc9860-pinctrl";
+	reg = <0x402a0000 0x10000>;

+	};

+	vbc_iis0_0: iis0_c {
+		sprd,pins = <34 0xc>;
+	};
