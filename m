Well, that's what the DT is for, right? As opposed to dump the data in
*every* kernel (Linux, U-Boot, BSD) for *every* SoC.
And, following this argument, why do we have reg and interrupt
properties if we could derive them from the compatible string as well?
Those are SoC specific and immutable by a board as well.

It seems the discussion went slightly heated and astray, but basically I
am after two things, maybe we should separate them:

1) Put the actual mux value into the DT, next to the already existing
function property. That is a small addition, but has the great effect of
avoiding to hard code this information for *each* supported SoC in
*every* kernel. Doing so just sounds like bonkers to me, sorry.

If there is really so much resistance against also *using* this
information from Linux, I would be happy to at least add the already
existing and generic "pinmux" property to the binding. This way we could
add those values to the .dtsi(s), and other OSes could use them. No need
for a driver change in Linux, then. I am not buying this molly guard
argument at all, but this way we could keep this protection in the kernel.
This would immediately allow to get an easy DT based pinctrl driver on
the road for U-Boot.

2) Add the (very few!) properties to the pinctrl root node that we need
to size and enumerate the pins. This would allow generic pinctrl driver
support, so one thing less to worry when bringing up a new SoC (variant).

So my main goal is more about the binding and the DTs.
Linux could just ignore them, though I don't see a good reason for us to
not make use of those for good.

I believe that both are not really a big issue and I don't really
understand why there is so much opposition towards it.

Fair enough.

That's a shame, maybe it's to limit the amount of review and maintenance
needed? And it's a safe bet to have a simple binding, where nothing can
go wrong? And since we can't predict the future?

I don't know, but in this case we have quite a sample of already
existing controllers and can make an much more educated guess for a
better and compatible binding, kind of in hindsight.

Well, so far I only got some push back from Thierry, Maxime and you. My
understanding of the DT maintainers' position is to leave those details
to the subsystem maintainers.

Cheers,
Andre.
