This adds the gpio-ranges property so that the GPIO pins are initialized
by the GPIO framework and not pinctrl. This fixes a circular dependency
between these two frameworks so GPIO hogging can be used on this board.

This was not tested on this particular hardware, however this same
change was tested on qcom-pm8941 using a LG Nexus 5 (hammerhead) phone.
