NACK! But a year ago it would have been a completely valid reasoning.

In kernel v4.6 I introduced a GPIO character device, and since v4.7
it is possible to name lines from the device tree using gpio-names
like I do in this patch:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-arm-kernel&m=146672328215354&w=2

For the kernel v4.8 merge window I am also adding ABIs to hammer
GPIOs up/down and to listen for GPIO events using the character
device.

Just checkout linux-next, go to tools/gpio and enjoy the new stuff
from userspace as it was designed by the example of lsgpio,
gpio-hammer and gpio-event-mon.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
