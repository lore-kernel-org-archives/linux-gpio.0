Here the change is only required to pass the regmap handle from mfd to 
the rtc driver. There is no change for rest of rtc driver.

RTC i2c regmap registered with i2c dummy client device, not with actual 
parent device and hence we need to register RTC with this dummy i2c 
client device. This way we can get regmap handle by using the 
dev_get_regmap(pdev->dev.parent).
