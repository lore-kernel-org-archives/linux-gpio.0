Once you have a hardware, where one of several IRQ users is not attached to the
inverter you need this inverter node anyway, caused by the mixed polarities.
Also some IRQ controllers, like ARM GIC, only support rising edge interrupts
(also level high).
This might get important if there are dedicated IRQ pads connected to several
users.

Just my 2 cents.
