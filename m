My concern is simply that if people can get basic functionality with the
generic driver they won't bother describing the details of the more
specific binding, and you'll never be able to use the board with a
better driver without having to modify the dt later.

I guess the question boils down to how much we care about that
situation.

They're certianly both valid. I fear they may become mutually exclusive
(people only define one or the other, and the bindings drift and become
incompatible).

I mean entries. If people describe the "dat", "set," "clr" registers
from the simple-gpio binding, they may also need some
"nvidia,tegra20-gpio"-specific reg entry describing the whole register
set (which will likely overlap). Describing things twice seems odd to
me.

If that's the case, we need to ensure that the bindings for any more
specific binding compatible with simple-gpio is a strict superset of the
simple-gpio binding (and this needs to be clear from the start in the
binding document for simple-gpio). Presumably, any more specific binding
*must* have one or more reg-names entries for its more useful data.

Ok, that sounds like what I was getting at above. I'd want a push-back
on simple-gpio usage without a more-specific binding also being
documented.

That would be my preference. That also caters for the case of a device
that happens to be usable with more than one generic binding
simultaneously.

That certainly makes sense. I'd also like to aim for new dts maintaining
the old functionality on old kernels, or we're still stuck with a
dtb<->kernel version requirement.

Thanks,
Mark.
