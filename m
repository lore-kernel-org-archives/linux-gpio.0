That's fine, if you've tested it and it's a problem the above will do.

I'm still little curious as to why it's necessary to depend on the
same symbols your dependencies depend on.

How far up the chain is it possible to go?=20

config DEPA

config DEPB
       select DEPA

config DEPC
       select DEPB
       depends on DEPA

config DEPD
       select DEPC
       depends on DEPA
       depends on DEPB

config YOU
       select DEPD
       depends on DEPA
       depends on DEPB
       depends on DEPC

Etc.

I'm sure when you've been trying to find answers to questions you've
found the help helpful (or maybe it was poorly underwritten and you
didn't find it useful at all).  Without the help, all these drivers
are just a selection of random letters, numbers and code/project
names.  It's the help which brings them to life, so to speak.

Please describe the device and what it provides.  No sales pitch
required.

I'm sure many drivers, mention the word driver at one point.  However,
this is specifically regarding the file title/header.
