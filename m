I think we should focus on defining a new user-space interface rather
than make it easier to use the current one (it should really only be
used for development or one-off hacks IMO).

Yes, something like that. As you mention above, if it was possibly to
define those names in firmware, even the current sysfs interface would
expose the pins as

	/sys/class/gpio/<function>

rather than say /sys/class/gpio/gpio279, thereby solving the gpio-number
look-up issue. Well, to actually make the pin available *from* userspace
you'd currently still need the number...
