The only documentation I see is:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/resource-names.txt

That documents the basics of the *-names properties, not their expected
usage.

In practice, they're only useful if you have enough optional resources
that fixed indexing isn't sufficient, and you need to use
platform_get_resource_byname().

So IMO, their purposes seems to be one of these:
(1) functional (e.g., for get_resource_byname(), when you have more than
    one optional resource)
(2) self-documentation (which might run counter to #1, as you begin
    generating too many unique names)
(3) no purpose

So IMO, if you ever want (1), they shouldn't have instance-specific
naming, but should use something generic to the device class. Otherwise,
they are just self-documentation, and aren't functionally useful. So
IMO, these sorts of names:

	interrupt-names = "upg_gio_aon", "upg_gio_aon_wakeup";

work better as functional descriptions:

	interrupt-names = "gio", "wakeup";

But in the end, I wouldn't foresee you needing to do (1), so you're left
with (2) or (3), at which point I'm not sure if you should even mention
the property.

Just my 2 cents (and those cents may not even be worth face value),
Brian
