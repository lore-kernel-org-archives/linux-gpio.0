We're freezing it. It can be used in parallel for the foreseeable
future but the chardev is default-enabled in order to make people
prefer that, the sysfs (/sys/class/gpio) needs to be turned on
explicitly.

The sysfs is a sad story because it is completely stateless, i.e.
we have no clue of knowing if a userspace process is actually
alive and using a certain GPIO or not, there is nothing that closes
it down if the consumer dies etc.

Also lsgpio, also the kernel can print "I can's use GPIO n just
right now because a userspace consumer is using it for <string>"
we just chose the model to name both ends of the
GPIO line, the producer and the consumer. The producer and
consumer can both label their end.

Of course I could just hard-code all userspace consumers as
the string "userspace" if people prefer that.

Yes people were talking about evdev as a good example of
how to do this. I will have to look into that code, it seems like
a good idea.

Sounds about right. Can you point me to a place where anonymous
file handles are delivered out from the kernel?

What happens in practice is that if the back-end supports
the .set_multiple() callback, and it turns out that it can be
performed by a single register write or so, then it will happen
simultaneously. Else the kernel will issue individual .set()
calls.

We have no .get_multiple(). Maybe one day someone will
implement it :/

I guess
one filehandle for reading n GPIOs
one filehandle for writing/toggling n GPIOs
one event filehandler for getting events from one GPIO

Each which will relase its GPIO[s] at close.

No just one FD for one GPIO line for events. Else it's
going to get hopeless.

TBH I never quite wrapped my head around that forked irqchip
thing, it scares the living daylights out of me. Its like a virtual irqchip
and there it looses me.

A logic analyzer seems like a pretty extreme case of general
purpose input, does it not?

Hm I'll CC you on the patches when we get there and you can tell
me what to split out in its own .c/.h file :)

I can easily see people setting up systems that will use a bunch of
GPIOs alongside a bunch of sensors or DAC/ADCs so I hope for the
GPIO and IIO worlds to stay close.
