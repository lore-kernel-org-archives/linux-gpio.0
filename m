/sys/class/gpio and the pin numbers is a flat space, but the line names
must not necessarily be unique. With a new userspace interface duplicate
line names could be handled.

Consider also DT overlays and hot-pluggable buses (e.g. USB when it gets
a DT representation). A driver for a device on such a bus, be it USB or
Greybus, could even be providing line names through some other means
when registering the controller.

Should we then refuse such "userspace hogs" from being requested from
the kernel? This can't really be considered hardware description...

Indeed. I'm just suggesting we not rush into adding more ABI, before
really determining what these interfaces should look like.

Really? But that's not our problem, right?

I keep rejecting vendor-specific gpio ioctl-interfaces for usb-serial
devices, while the current sysfs interface really isn't a good
replacement (but we must use standard interfaces of course). It's not
just about the line names.
