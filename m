Should the new gpiod_get_array() function also have a way to specify the
flags similar to gpiod_get()? I agree that making it return all GPIOs of
a given function is a good idea. And given that GPIOs associated with
the same function probably behave very similarly it should be safe to
add flags handling to that as well. That is, I don't think we'd need to
worry about different GPIOs of the same function requiring different
directions or initial values (note that polarity is still handled by the
GPIO specifier).
