The 8 bit limit is in the HW.

IIRC what has been proposed before is to re-program the polarity of edge
detection withing the ISR. This would match your concern that it is racy.

Here it's about using two parent irq's, one programmed to react on the
rising edge whilst the other is triggered in case of falling edge.
Would you consider this to be racy too?

Means what? There is no acceptable way to support EDGE_BOTH on this HW?
In this case I could stop here as for me this feature is important.

Would be somewhat a pity as there is a working solution. If it doesn't fit
into the current irq(chip) framework, shouldn't this be considered a gap
in the framework?
