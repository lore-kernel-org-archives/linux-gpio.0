Same way. You will have common numbering over the chip [0, 9]. It will
be just an abstraction inside the driver.

I don't get this. You are telling that the property of "always output"
can be assigned to any 3 out of 10?
Above states the opposite, so, it's clear to me that abstraction of 2
GPIO chips over 1 can be utilized here.

+1 (asked same in review of new version)

+1. I don't believe the hardware / firmware doesn't care about clear
and always predictable state.
