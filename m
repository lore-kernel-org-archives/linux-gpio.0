I agree with you. I also understand the interrupts.txt binding doc as it 
lists only a common/possible cell format, but it's purpose is not to 
restrict it to this.

I send an updated patch, that uses the drivers xlate function to parse the 
interrupt property in a few minutes.

Thanks for clarifying this,
