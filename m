I was asked to review this, to make sure that Linus wasn't waiting for
my ack or anything. But now I see that you have not added him as a

pick appropriate recipients in the future.

Part of the .owner above you have my

@Linus, this still applies and builds cleanly on linux-next.
Would you be okay dropping the owner assignment while applying this patch?
