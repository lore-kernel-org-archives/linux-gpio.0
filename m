How does this circuit really look? Can you sketch something so
we understand what is going on electronically here?

The way I imagine most drive strength out there works is by simply
connection more MOS-totempoles after each other and each of them
has a production-technology-related max output current like 4mA, so
by putting two in a series yoy double that to 8 mA.

Is that what you mean with "current regulator"?

If you mean rather "output impedance", that is something else and
something we need a new (generic) property for. I never saw that
before, really.

Yeah but is this really the same thing even ...

I agree with that. Also for skewrate and output time delays
(skew delay).

It's very unclear how cell libraries really implement this.
But with drive strength I thought we knew it ...
