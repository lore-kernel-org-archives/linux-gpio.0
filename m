Fair enough.

Yup, do that in IIO for event chardevs.  See

Would be good to let userspace know if this can be done or not...
Otherwise 'weird' timing bugs are likely to confuse people.

Sounds right.  Though a given userspace consumer may well use a
number of each of those..

Certainly fiddlier ;)

*laughs*  It's actually much simpler than you'd think.  We'd just ended
up implementing our own logic for handling making an interrupt do a whole
load of different things (registered by different drivers).

Arnd Bergman (IIRC) pointed out that the irq chip stuff does it already
so we switched over.  Was hairy in the early days because of stupid
restrictions on how many IRQs platforms would support, but I think that
has mostly gone away now.  Lots of MFD parts use them the same way these
days.

Yup - always target the extremes - it's more fun that way ;)

Meh. Can always do it later if it makes sense - only have to get the userspace
right at this stage.

Absolutely. Nothing the odd little bridge driver can't deal with as long
as we can put in the relevant bits to avoid jumping backwards and forwards
from userspace.

Anyhow, the really fun bit is seeing what horrendous userspace hacks
occur because we gave them the means to do crazy things ;)
