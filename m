Could you provide link on this thread^, pls?

Curious, it looks like Rob Herring has just proposed to encode offsets =
& bits in DT:
"Re: [PATCH 2/6] leds: add device tree bindings for syscon LEDs"
http://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg354182.html

Nothing to say :) - DT is funny thing. It has such good feature as phan=
dle, but
people continue hard-coding relation between HW blocks in code :(

Any way, Thanks for your comments. I'll wait a bit then update and rese=
nd.
