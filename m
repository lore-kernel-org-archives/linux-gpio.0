This set of patches adds support for the WM8280 and WM8281
codecs to the Wolfson Arizona drivers.

Just another resend on this series, if it would expedite
the process I would be happy if we could just merge the MFD
patches then I can push the other patches through their
respective trees once that hits mainline, but at the moment
all the patches are gated by a build dependency on the MFD
patches.

Thanks,
Charles
