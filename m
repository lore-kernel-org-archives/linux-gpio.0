At the same time, the family name is mostly valid too.

We do share some DTSI across some SoCs already by their family name
(sun5i.dtsi for the A10s/A13/R8, sun8i-a23-a33.dtsi for the A23 and
A33, etc.)

The opposite can be said too.

The A31 is quite different from the A33, while the A83 is much closer
to the H3 than it is to the A80. Their marketing scheme is messy. In
all aspects. We have a scheme that worked, I'd really like to stick
with it.

Both of these are true, but are about the DT filenames, and not the
compatibles. I'd agree with you on this one now that we have
per-vendor subfolders in boot/dts, but it was not the case before, and
I'm pretty sure that to anyone that is not aware of the Allwinner SoCs
names, having an A<number>.dtsi in arch/arm/boot/dts, it would be
about a Cortex-A<number>, and definitely not an SoC from some random
vendor.

So, droping it in the filenames, why not. But I'd really like to keep
the same compatible scheme.
