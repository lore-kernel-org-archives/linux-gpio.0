Rob suggested to use the type also for Boolean and tristate. I think it 
is good to have for all places that what type of values are valid.

Here, I think I can go similar to regulators where child node name 
identifies the regulators.

     fps-config {
         fps0 {
             maxim,fps-time-period-us = <1280>;
             maxim,fps-enable-input = <FPS_EN_SRC_EN0>;
         };

         fps1 {
             maxim,fps-time-period-us = <2560>;
             maxim,fps-enable-input = <FPS_EN_SRC_EN1>;
         };

         fps2 {
             maxim,fps-time-period-us = <640>;
             maxim,fps-enable-input = <FPS_EN_SRC_SW>;
         };
     };

So node name gives the FPS name.

OK, I will add different dt binding doc in respective driver and squash 
that with respected submodule drivers.
