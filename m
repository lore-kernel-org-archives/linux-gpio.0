Sorry, I cannot spell them out without guessing myself, there is no
documentation this commit message is based on the explanation found
in the patches from here:

https://github.com/01org/ProductionKernelQuilts/tree/master/uefi/cht-m1stable/patches

Warning there are over 5000 patches there (yes really that seems to
be how android on x86 gets shipped).

Well I guess I could go over the PDF with the register documentation
that may if we're lucky explain the acronyms, but often it just uses
the acronyms and that's it.

Yes, you've got the gist of it right this has nothing to do with GPIOs
at all, but the ACPI firmware representation of the AML event handler
which needs to be called when the PME_B0 interrupt fires is in the
form of a GpioInt and the ACPI node has _AEI and _L02 methods to
match.

Right.

Right.

Actually I started out with a stand-alone platform driver which duplicated
some code from gpiolib-acpi.c (not copy pasted but I ended up writing more
or less the same code) you never saw that version as it was not send to
you but to the platform/x86 maintainers.

That version got review comments asking me to redo it in a way which avoided
the duplication and the version you are seeing now is the result of that.

That is where it started, I'm fine with putting it back there.

Ack, if you're ok with using the gpio driver abstraction while
putting the driver in drivers/platform/x86 that might be the
best way to deal with this.
