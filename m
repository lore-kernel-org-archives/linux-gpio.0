No problem, at the beginning, I only wanted to enable the strict. Doing
this involves that I have to remove pinctrl nodes for the pins which are
going to be request through the gpiolib to avoid conflicts. These pins
were configured with bias-pull-up. That's why I try to add the bias
support.

Thanks for the detailed answer about what you have in mind.

Well, yes and not! As a consequence of enabling strict mode, I have to
find another way to configure the pins.

Yes, I have noticed this issue.

Right, I have spotted some drivers to fix.

I will try to handle the ones related to the platforms I am using.
