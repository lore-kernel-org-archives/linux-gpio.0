In summary:
- Our GPIO doesn't support interrupt controller.
- There are 6 pins which used the external interrupt from GIC, so all
setup for those irqs are from gic driver. The GPIO driver only
configure to wire those lines.

For your concern:
- That's correct: if we use that defined, the gpio driver never saw
the connection here (That's why it already is configued at the
beginning).
- At the first time, we tried to use the define: <&sbgpio 13 1>, it
means using the GPIO_DS13, it will go into the GPIO driver to setup,
but there is another problem which I have sent out to all of you:
+ It will go into gpio_keys_setup_key (gpio_keys.c driver) function,
then set the irqflags = IRQF_TRIGGER_RISING | IRQF_TRIGGER_FALLING,
but the gic only support IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH && IRQF_TRIGGER_RISING,
so it always returns failed at gpio_keys_setup_key function. Please
see the gic_set_type at gic driver.

static int gic_set_type(struct irq_data *d, unsigned int type)
{
        void __iomem *base = gic_dist_base(d);
        unsigned int gicirq = gic_irq(d);

        /* Interrupt configuration for SGIs can't be changed */
        if (gicirq < 16)
                return -EINVAL;

        /* SPIs have restrictions on the supported types */
        if (gicirq >= 32 && type != IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH &&
                            type != IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING)
                return -EINVAL;

        return gic_configure_irq(gicirq, type, base, NULL);
}
+ Another issue: in order gpio_key works it needs the status of GPIO.
For our chip, when the GPIO is configued as interrupt, we need to
access to GIC register to read the real status, it is not acceptable
to implement accessing GIC registers at gpio driver. The function
irq_get_irqchip_state(..) also doesn't work in our chip too. Because
it needs to access different offset.

I will look into it.

Is there possible if:
- Keep GPIO8..GPIO as interrupt by default.
- Anyone want to use these GPIO pins as GPIO, we will re-configure
them to GPIO mode ?
