In my case [1] I need 2 "virtual devices" (and more in future) to be
part of an USB OTG port control. I call it virtual because they are too
simple components connected to no bus and controlled by GPIOs:
- a fixed regulator controlled by GPIO
- a generic mux controlled by GPIO

I'd need to request official ACPI HID for them in order to make them
self-sufficient.

I can go ahead with this approach, but we have many examples of drivers
on upstream that are platform driver expecting to receive gpio via
platform data (e.g. extcon-gpio). The ACPI table of some products on
market were defined following this concept and won't change anymore.
