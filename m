As all of this driver should be taken though the MFD tree how
can this gpiolib change be handled? If we have gpio.parent it
will not build on MFD, with gpio.dev it will fail to build when
the changes are merged from the gpio subsystem. As the change
has not been merged into linux-next as far a I can tell maybe
this should be taken as is, then when the gpiolib change is
made this can be changed with all the other drivers?
