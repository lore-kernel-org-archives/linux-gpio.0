Version 4 of this series the big change here is splitting up
the device tree into having a node for each of the MFD child
drivers. More detailed change logs are given on each patch.

Lee doesn't like the idea of having both mfd_add_devices and
of_platform_populate in the MFD driver. Stephen had asked on a
previous spin to move the fixed clocks out of the clock driver
into device tree and there is a fixed regulator as well that
is specified through device tree. Those require having the
of_platform_populate there which left the only solution being
to move the MFD children into device tree as well.

I have moved the relevant DT settings to be attached to their
respective nodes in DT although I guess another option would
be to leave all the config on the parent node and just use
the child nodes for binding in the drivers, but I decided that
was less consistent with other DT usage. But could switch over
to it if people prefer.

Thanks,
Charles
