Yes, feel free to squash into your original patch with my S-o-b,
keep your authorship.

You may want to raise FASTPATH_NGPIO to something like 384, 448 or 512
to accommodate for the Intel chips Andy mentioned.  It's kind of a
"640k should be enough for everyone" thing but I'd expect the performance
impact of the extra bytes on the stack / memsetting them to zero
to be absolutely negligible.

Thanks!

Lukas
