Actually one more thought, perhaps as a halfway for now i could
look into removing the readables and defaults. We lose some things
like error checking that we are reading real registers but as
this driver doesnt currently do cache syncs we might be able to
get away with this for now.

Unless anyone strenuously objects i will have a look at the
options there. As well as looking at wider refactoring but aiming
further out.

Thanks,
Charles
