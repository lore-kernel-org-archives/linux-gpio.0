Yes, you'd need to configure your gpio chip before you start using it.

And for your RPi use case, things need not change much if the default
mode if undefined, or the default DT, continue to allow for full
flexibility.

But I imagine that even for such use cases some people will want to
configure pin directionality and default modes in DT (blob or overlay)
to limit potential damage from bugs in userspace applications.

And everyone should benefit from persistent, predictable pin names.

Yes, but in this case you argued using an example that I had already
discussed in the part of the email that you left out (i.e. how to not
break userspace by continuing to allow full flexibility if desired).
