Oh, yeah, though it didn't fix a potential issue described below.

It would be helpful if anyone can test it.

Btw, which particular driver do you have in mind that might be broken
after such change? Ah, Goodix is a vendor of touchscreens, right?

I'm going through drivers which are using ACPI enumeration and
gpiod_get() API to create mapping tables. I didn't touch drivers/input/
folder yet.

So, potential problems might be there:

drivers/input/touchscreen/elants_i2c.c
drivers/input/touchscreen/goodix.c
drivers/input/touchscreen/melfas_mip4.c
drivers/input/touchscreen/raydium_i2c_ts.c
drivers/input/touchscreen/silead.c
drivers/input/touchscreen/surface3_spi.c

(except silead which Hans tested few times)

I used to have issues with unbind/bind cycle with pointer to struct
device * (IIRC platform device), but you probably right since pointer to
struct acpi_device is used here in your change.

I will remove this paragraph from commit message.

Thanks for review!
