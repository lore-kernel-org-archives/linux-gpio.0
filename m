It should follow DT *de facto* standard bindings like "ngpios" (though
it's not needed in ACPI case IIRC) and other properties.

Wait, runtime muxing is a matter of requesting another function (usually
GPIO) and putting it back afterwards. Do you really need anything like
this at *runtime*?

Pin control design is not compatible with hardware (too abstract), but
that is the problem of DT as well: I'm referring here to not carefully
designed so called "pin states". This is another story and has nothing
specific for ACPI.
