Actually on second look, this takes the sx150 to pin control territory.

I am starting to feel like a move to drivers/pinctrl/* might be warranted.

Neil you worked on other pin controllers IIRC, do you think it would
be much work to make a combined GPIO+pinctrl driver and move
this over to drivers/pinctrl?

I know refactoring across subsystems can be a pain, but at least
I'm maintaining both and happy to help out.

Yours,
