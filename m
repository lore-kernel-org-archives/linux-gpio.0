I think we still have cases were the choice has to be done by the user.
For example, the board designer offers several GPIOs, some can be muxed
to the ISI device (there is two possible configurations). Among these pins, 
we can use some of them for I2C devices.

The user will see that he could get two I2C devices by mixing ISI
signals. Why not doing it. That's why I would like to keep some
protection, a 'soft' protection such as group.

Ok it was the feeling I have, but I am not sure about the pros and cons
to create artificial groups. Any point of view about this?
