In hindsight, that probably should have been "motorola,mc74hc595" instead.
Recently I read that Motorola invented the 74hc59x for their "new" SPI bus
as that time, as the 74164 is not 100% SPI-compatible.

Given the limitations of the '164 for SPI, is the same true for '165, and
should it be "[...]74[...]597" instead?

They're all supposed to be "compatible".
Personally, I wouldn't object to just "74595", cfr. "ns16550a".
