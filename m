I'd argue that you would find out about lots of clever/insane use cases that 
don't fit this model if you looked at all the hardware available out there, 
especially non-phone devices. Your SPI example is a good one, I've seen SPI 
being used in unidirectional mode only, with only MISO or MOSI mattering. In 
that case the other pin could be used as a GPIO for a totally unrelated 
purpose when the design is short on GPIOs or when GPIOs have been allocated 
without any knowledge of the Linux pinctrl subsystem.

Looking at the sh-pfc driver, I wish the hardware had followed the pinctrl-
single model. sh-pfc is a good example of how bloated a pinctrl driver can 
become when there is no choice but model all the relationships betweens pins 
and functions in C code.
