What do you mean by "release"? The device tree support for the gpio-
mcp23s08 driver and thus the "mcp" string came in with v3.9. This is stable 
but not longterm.

I am the developer of the device tree support for that driver and I am not 
aware of any user, but surely I can not guarantee it.

I never imagined how hard it would be. ;-)
I presented both variants:
1.) simply add mcp to vendor-prefixes.txt
2.) change the driver to microchip and add microchip to vendor-prefixes.txt

May one of the maintainers decide which one to take or even take none of 
the patches.
Or do you need a third variant with both strings in the driver and 
microchip in vendor-prefixes?
