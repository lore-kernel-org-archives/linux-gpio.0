Right.  I understand the fundamentals of how Kconfig works, I guess I
just hoped it would be better in cases like this.

Yes, perhaps.

That's a very single minded view.  The help isn't just for people
looking to enable drivers.  Think about the maintenance aspect and
people who are either just curious or wish to learn more.  The help
should be useful (helpful), rather than each of them saying "enable
this to add support for <enter crappy non-descriptive model number
here> and all of it's other features".

If there really are "other features" and you know what they are, then
list them.  If there aren't or *might be*, but you don't know what
they are just omit the phrase.  Saying "and some other stuff" is a
cop-out.

Ah ha!  Exactly my point.  So if it's fluff just remove it.
