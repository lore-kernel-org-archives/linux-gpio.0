Sounds good. Do you by any chance have a pointer to some documentation
explaining this in some more detail ?

The gpio-ich driver already has some magic to detect that condition - I
noticed that I can not request all GPIO pins on all hardware. Either case,
the gpio pins I am interested in are well defined on the hardware I am
dealing with, so I can be sure I won't step on some unexpected use.

Thanks!
