Which IRQ number exist? Perhaps the IRQ IDs match some specific HW register?

Why is the DT required to define a default state? If the board doesn't
need to set up any pinctrl settings, surely it shouldn't have to define
the default state.

These aren't nodes. Those are properties that contain phandles that
refer to nodes.

What contains "these nodes"?

Why repeat that?

I would say "values" not "options", as I think I pointed out before, but
I supopse I don't care.

The following might make it clear where these optional nodes sit:

Optional sub nodes of "regulators":

Required or optional?
