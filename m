I've run into this now on our mobile SoCs after I pull in commit
8e51533780ba ("pinctrl: qcom: add get_direction function").
Before that commit we never read each pin of the device. On our
mobile SoCs we have devicetree and it feels like having that
describe which pins are available and not available is
half-duplicating information we would already have via consumers
indicating which pins they care about. I don't see any value
beyond system wide debug in figuring out the default pin
configuration of a pin that doesn't have a consumer in Linux.

Could we remove the pin direction finding part here in
gpiochip_add_pin_range() and lazily resolve the pin direction
when a pin is requested? We would need a similar check in the msm
specific debugfs code where we skip pins that aren't requested.
This is basically a revert of commit 72d320006177 ("gpio: set up
initial state from .get_direction()").

ACPI can still describe only the pin ranges that they care about
exposing, but from the devicetree side it's been working well
enough to not touch pins that aren't used by anything in Linux.
