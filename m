Can you point to schematics and electrical characteristics of such buffer?
(Yes, I can imagine one case where it's possible to have an
"automatic" switch based on which current is bigger output of your
side or remote's. But! I would like to see actual specifications to
prove this or otherwise.)

Please, post a link to it or copy essential parts.
I'm quite skeptical  that cheap hardware can implement something more
costable than simplest open-source / open-drain + bias.
