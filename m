That's right, I found the time to implement the macro suggestion you
made during the get_multiple/set_multiple patchset for the PC104 GPIO
drivers a while ago.

This macro greatly simplifies the callback function implementations in
those drivers and reduces the repeated code that kept appearing among
those drivers. Hopefully it can be useful for other drivers as well.

Okay, I'll come up with a better name and submit a version 3 of this
patchset.

Ah, you are correct, I'll remove this line then.
