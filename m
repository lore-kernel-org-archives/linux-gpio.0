Only the pcal6524 has this problem (pcal9555a should be fine).
IMHO, it does not matter since nobody is currently using it by in-tree =
DTS.

Will come for review today.

I have tested it by some ugly but simple hack (will include the patch),
but we have to consider:

* the request of LEVEL_LOW vs. EDGE_FALLING is defined in the driver of =
the attached device
  i.e. changing it there might break a lot of systems where the =
interrupt-controller can handle
  LEVEL_LOW properly
* I could not find any code that allows to overwrite it by DT (by the =
second parameter of interrupts =3D <number type>)
* EDGE_FALLING as a replacement of LEVEL_LOW may loose interrupts if =
multiple interrupts are
  present and the connected chip does not provide a pulse for each one
* I am not sure if the tca/pca hardware can really handle LEVEL =
interrupts - so it might need some
  emulation (repeat the irq while the input is still active after the =
handler did run)

Anyways, the pcal6524 basically works in interrupt mode and code can =
always be improved.

There is another thing I came across: the pcal6524 has a built-in =
pull-up/down option
which seems to be enabled by default, which might make trouble if there =
are external
pull-downs in the circuits. This is different to the pin-compatible =
tca6424.

So I am tempted to turn off this pull-up/down by probe code to stay =
compatible.
The right thing would be to define some pinctrl but that is beyond my =
capabilities
and capacity for this chip.

BR and thanks,
Nikolaus
