Yes. I'll fix that.

There was something special to do with the way dependencies are
processed, but I can't remember right now what that was. I'd have to
take another look at this to see if this "default y" pattern is still
necessary for this driver.

I have no objection to moving the source into pinctrl/cirrus

Those are real names. Each pin is dual labelled with a "GPIOn" name and
also its alternate function (if it has one). The mapping of alternate
functions to GPIO pins isn't 1:1 across codecs. The GPIOn name is
consistent across codecs. If your pinctrl config is needing to refer to
the pin name, instead of the alternate function group, it can only be to
use it as a GPIO so the GPIO name is more relevant. This is what I was
trying to imply in my comment but using fewer words.

I can do that.

Yes, I'll add some info
