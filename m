Ok. I can invert the logic and push it into the core part of the
code. I'll leave the ACPI part in the msm driver.

I'll cook that up right now to do the inverse thing in the
gpiolib core code with a 'reserved-gpio-ranges' property. I
haven't looked in much detail, but I would hope that it would
work pretty easily. Should it be decoupled from the
GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP config? If the idea is generic, then it may not
be related to irq lines, but for the qcom driver it was all fine
because all three concepts: irq, gpios, and pins have a one to
one relationship. The only place it breaks down is if we have
more pins than gpios, in which case I punted and just considered
non-gpio pins as always valid.
