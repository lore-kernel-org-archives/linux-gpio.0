I do like when the format of DT properties is obvious, so I think the
appropriate format for multiple dtest lines would be: "qcom,dtest-buffer
= <1, 2>;"

So let's punt on the multiple dtest lines for now and just support one.
If we in the future add support for arrays of lines that would still be
backwards compatible with the single case.
