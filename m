OK thanks.

This is usually used to narrow the compile coverage to an arch so
that the autobuilders do not explode on the driver when they try
to enable and compile it for every arch in the world using randconfig.

Tentatively OK. If you are sure it will actually happen, generally
I don't like "design for the future" I prefer "design for here and now".

If you were using syscon to access the register instead of remapping
then this problem would go away, because then the pin control
and the GPIO driver can simply just write into the same registers
to change the direction, because regmap provides marshalling
(serialization) and locking of register access so you don't even
need a spinlock or anything to share: you're already sharing the
regmap abstraction.

This is part of the beauty of doing this with syscon+regmap and
makes me even more convinced that it is the right solution for these
drivers.

If you're worried about the pin controller changing the direction of
the GPIOs behind the back of the GPIO driver: that is what the
.get_direction() callback in the gpio_chip is for, i.e. it is not a
problem.

So avoid that entire dilemma by removing the entire
cross-dependency. Use syscon+regmap and just write into
the direction registers from the pin controller driver.

And I'm not convinced that having several gpiochips spawn from one
device is a good idea.

Ranges can be registered from boardfiles. In fact that was how
it was devised from the beginning, OF ranges were added later.
