We won't run into the issue with the MFD counting the IRQs since the
interrupts property was removed and the interrupt-controller property
was added to device tree in the same patch. The interrupts property that
we ultimately don't need was the issue that I ran into with the MFD
subsystem.

However to be certain, I retested and we need the temporary hack since
pmic_gpio_to_irq in this series uses the new SPMI IRQ controller. It
breaks as soon as patch 4 in this series (qcom: spmi-gpio: add support
for hierarchical IRQ chip) is applied but starts working again at patch
5 (ARM: dts: qcom: pm8941: add interrupt controller).

I'll respin this series this weekend with the temporary hack and drop it
later in the series. Sorry about the noise and thanks for the
reviewed-bys.
