We can put the driver in drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-axp209.c from day
one, add in comments stating that it only implements GPIO
for now and that the GPIO portion must call
pinctrl_request_gpio() and the pin controller must implement
.gpio_request_enable() the day it is added so the GPIOs do
not conflict with other use of the pins.

Requireing a huge slew of upfront code is a bit hard on simple
drivers I think.

Also we have the solution in drivers/mfd/stmpe.c that just add
a simple mux code when pins on mixsigs or simple expanders
can just mux some two-three different functions, then I think
pin control may be a bit too thick overhead. (Not sure where
the limit is though.)
