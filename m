Yes.

You could have functions A..F, and require the user to determine what 
option they want for each pin, find the pin-specific mux function value 
for each pin, and put that into the DT (or other pinmux data source). 
For example, the bcm2835 pinctrl driver works this way.

In that case, each of the functions A..F could be selected on each pin, 
so you'd have a very simple "get pins for function" implementation.

Alternatively, you could define a logic function per IO controller or 
signal that gets pinmuxed. In the example above, FLEXCOM2_IO2 is one 
such example. Given that set of functions, you'd need a mapping table to 
convert from the logical functions seen by the pinctrl subsystem to the 
HW values that need to be written into registers. For example, the Tegra 
pinctrl drivers work this way.

In that case, each (pinctrl) function could only be selected on a 
specific subset of all pins/groups, and so you'd probably need a 
table-based implementation of "get pins for function".

I don't think so no. I'm not sure why you'd consider multiplying 128 and 
7 here. I'd expect 128 groups since you have 128 pins[1].

Well, it's possible to have slightly more groups if, say, mux function 
is selectable per pin, whereas something else like drive strength is 
configured by a register that affects multiple pins at once. You'd need 
separate sets of groups for muxing and for drive strength configuration. 
Some Tegra SoCs are like this. Still, we just add the different sets of 
groups together here, not multiply. The overall set of groups is not 
that much larger than the set of pins.

I don't think I agree. The HW level groups are the individual pins, so I 
think the second option is clearer and more correct. What is the 
"sdmmc1_0" group in the first example? Does any such thing even exist in HW?

I don't see anything in your description which implies pinctrl isn't 
perfectly suitable for your HW.

Note that I'm on vacation for a couple weeks soon, and I don't expect to 
follow this conversation during that time. Ultimately, LinusW owns the 
pinctrl subsystem, and you need to convince him of any changes.
