Okay, now it is clearer. I don't want this documented as a common
property because I don't want to encourage it's use. I only see 2
users currently: ST and PIC32.

Looking at one example, it appears to be redundant already.
nomadik-gpio-chips property already gives you the index. The index of
the phandles is the bank numbering. PIC32 could do the same.
