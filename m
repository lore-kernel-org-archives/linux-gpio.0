It should enable the interrupt - the end of that does:

        if (handle != handle_bad_irq && is_chained) {
                irq_settings_set_noprobe(desc);
                irq_settings_set_norequest(desc);
                irq_settings_set_nothread(desc);
                desc->action = &chained_action;
                irq_startup(desc, true);
        }

and indeed, I see that it gets enabled on Assabet.  That irq_startup()
should result in the irqchip's irq_startup, irq_enable, or irq_unmask
method being called.

So, that should result in the IRQ to which the sa1111 is connected
being unmasked.

Chained interrupts don't appear in /proc/interrupts.

Hmm.  Looking at pxa_cplds_irqs, that's trying to support the CPLD
interrupts using a very very old and inefficient technique.  The
whole point of the chained interrupt system is to avoid several
overheads in the system...  I'm curious why PXA moved away from that.

One of the problems is that we end up nesting irq_entry()/irq_exit()
which contains a lot of code, eg trying to run softirqs.  All that
stuff is pure overhead because we'll never get to run anything like
that in this path.

I'm also very concerned that the conversion is wrong.  The old code
has this comment in the irq_unmask function:

-       /* the irq can be acknowledged only if deasserted, so it's done here */
-       LUB_IRQ_SET_CLR &= ~(1 << lubbock_irq);

In other words, we "acknowledge" (really clear the latched status) of
the interrupt _after_ we've serviced the peripheral, not before.
The new code tries to clear down the interrupt when masking it - in
other words, before the peripheral handler has had a chance to clear
down its interrupt.

I suspect you're seeing about twice as many interrupt counts on your
ethernet interface because of this - you'll be entering the handler
once for the real interrupt, but because the clear-down was ineffective,
you end up re-entering it a second time when hopefully the peripheral
is no longer asserting the interrupt.

Masked where though - in the SA1111 or FPGA?

It shouldn't be required, as I say above, irq_set_chained_handler_and_data()
deals with unmasking the IRQ already.

I've some patches to convert mainstone, but they're not ready yet...
