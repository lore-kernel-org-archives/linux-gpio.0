I share your ambition to create something generic for this class
of hardware(s).

Why?
"memory-mapped-gpio" sits nicely with me.

Read another very generic binding for inspiration:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/register-bit-led.txt

I would just be more verbose:

data-in-register
data-out-set-register
data-out-clear-register
direction-output-register
direction-input-register

Some should be optional so we can support input-only
and output-only GPIO controllers too.

I would take this opportunity to add bindings also for stuff that
the generic MMIO driver does not support today but
could be made to support:

open-drain-register
open-source-register
debounce-register

etc

Just reference the generic docs.

I think it's better to imply that if there is no data-in-register
specified, then it is output-only etc.

Skip this. It is Linux-specific.
