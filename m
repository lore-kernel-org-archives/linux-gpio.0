There was an attempt a while back to standardize this like we do for 
device tree, but it fell apart.  Device-specific ACPI-only properties 
are not standarized.  This driver is initialized only on ACPI systems. 
It has no device tree binding.

GPIOs in device tree are defined completely differently than in ACPI. 
On DT, the kernel controls the pin muxing.  On ACPI, pins are muxed by 
firmware and never re-muxed by the operating system.  So all this driver 
does is expose a few pins as simple GPIOs.
