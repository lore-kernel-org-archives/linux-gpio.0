Thanks for giving me some examples. Let's take a look at these drivers.
My concern is that I didnn't want to have many and/or big tables in my
driver. I will have to update it for a new SoC even if the pin
controller is the same. I prefer to have it in the device as we did
before and as some drivers continue to do.

Sorry my mistake, I mean 896 possibilites since I have 128 groups for a
function.

If a user see this, I will have to take the datasheet to undersand what
using function E on this pin really means.

sdmmc1_0 group doesn't really exists as a group but a collection of
pins. The minimum requirement is to have CK, CMD and DAT0 signals. The
user can choose if he wants to use DAT1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and CD. Maybe he
would like to keep this pins available for another function.

This is what I have in my device tree.

pinctrl@fc038000 {
	group_defs {
		sdmmc1_0 {
			pins = <PIN_PA22__SDMMC1_CK>,
			       <PIN_PA28__SDMMC1_CMD>,
			       <PIN_PA18__SDMMC1_DAT0>,
			       <PIN_PA19__SDMMC1_DAT1>,
			       <PIN_PA20__SDMMC1_DAT2>,
			       <PIN_PA21__SDMMC1_DAT3>,
			       <PIN_PA30__SDMMC1_CD>;
		};
	};

	pinctrl_sdmmc1_default: sdmmc1_default {
		mux {
			function = "E";
			groups = "sdmmc1_0";
		};

		conf-cmd_data {
			pins = <PIN_PA28__SDMMC1_CMD>,
			       <PIN_PA18__SDMMC1_DAT0>,
			       <PIN_PA19__SDMMC1_DAT1>,
			       <PIN_PA20__SDMMC1_DAT2>,
			       <PIN_PA21__SDMMC1_DAT3>;
			bias-pull-up;
		};

		conf-ck_cd {
			pins = <PIN_PA22__SDMMC1_CK>,
			       <PIN_PA30__SDMMC1_CD>;
			bias-disable;
		};
	};
}

The only addition is the group_defs node because I don't want SoC
dependant tables in my driver.

It could but it doesn't fit all my requirements:
- no SoC dependant tables in the driver
- comprehensive sysfs

I agree that these two requirements could be controversial, particulary
driver tables vs DT. At the moment, I feel there are pros and cons which are
all admissible so in my opinion both approach should be acceptable.

Ok, I'll think about this discussion and try to see what in involves for
my case.
