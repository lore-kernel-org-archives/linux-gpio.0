Such trivial wrappers are easy write in the coffe break.
For those usecases the good old sysfs interface is really sufficient.

(I'm frequently replacing those kind of "abstraction layers" of sevaral
10kLoC in various client projects by just a few lines of really tiny
shim ...)

And relying on numeric gpio ids is generally a bad idea.
(exactly one of the kind of problems why certain clients call me in
great despair, when it broke again :p)

As said: numeric pin IDs are a *bad* idea.
If it's a *name* (=string), then that seems to be a usecase for labels.
For convenience, you could just pupulate the fs w/ proper symlinks that
are named by the pin names from the schematics.

When doing that, you could also kick out Intel and move to ARM, as quite
everybody else does ;-)

As said above: writing a small js wrapper for that is just a coffee
break job.

gpio's are already very low-level. Highlevel would be things like keys,
leds, etc.

That's one of the things I frequently have to teach my clients: first
make yourself clear about what you're *actually* doing with these pins
and then pick the right drivers.

Okay, we could talk about creating some nice oftree-overlay generators,
to make it easier for newbies. Or create some small DSL, perhaps w/ some
tiny GUI editor. But don't let them play w/ raw gpio's - this quickly
goes horribly wrong (I've seen that in the field, many times).

It's nice, that you folks (Siemens) are now doing your own controller,
so you can finally throw out the ugly AMX+co crap. But please don't
repeat their mistakes. We don't need yet another raspi for building
automation - we need a different programming model than the old PLC-
style spaghetti configuration :p

(oh, and if you add ATEX and railways certification, I might have a new
customer for you ;-))

Okay, that's getting far OT, so maybe we should continue off-list ;-)

They better should :p

Maybe because some field techs rather grab some beers and go to some
friend who happens to be a linux hacker, instead of burning their time
on the official channels those big corporate structures ;-)
