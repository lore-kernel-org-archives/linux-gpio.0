Both binding formats support this use-case as far as I can tell.
Since you seem to understand how it looks like with the inverter
node here is an example without it:

irqctrl: irq-controller {
    random-properties;
}

mcp23xxx0 {
    random-properties;

    /*=20
     * configure host interrupt input pin to be active high, since
     * nothing else is supported by the interrupt controller
     */
    interrupts =3D <&irqctrl ACTIVE_HIGH>;

    /*
     * configure chip interrupt output pin to be active low due to
     * line invert
     */
    microchip,irq-active-high;
}

mcp23xxx1 {
    random-properties;

    /*=20
     * shared irq, see description from other chip
     */
    interrupts =3D <&irqctrl ACTIVE_HIGH>;

    /*
     * configure chip interrupt output pin to be active high, since
     * it's routed through the line invert
     */
    /* microchip,irq-active-high; */
}
