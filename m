OK good that works too...

We have GPIO_OPEN_DRAIN in
include/dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h
that can be added on the consumer side of the GPIO line
in the DT, it should work (just like GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW for example).

For descriptor tables
include/linux/gpio/machine.h
provides the same mechanism with the flag GPIO_OPEN_DRAIN

Notice that in both cases it is the consumer that specifies that it
needs the line to be set up as open drain, not the controller,
as it is a resource, the consumer needs to request what it needs.

So this can be done already today. Unless there is some bug.
