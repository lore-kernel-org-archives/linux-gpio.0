This patch documents the conversion of various platform data options
that used to be availible to SX150x driver to device tree/OF form.

 which case it uses the default two cell specifier as described in
 Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt.
 
+Optional properties:
+
+- semtech,io-polarity: A bit-mask which enables polarity inversion for
+  		       each IO line in the expander. Setting the bit
+  		       at position n inverts the polarity of that IO
+  		       line, while clearing it results in normal
+  		       polarity. For chips with fewer than 16 IO pins,
+  		       high-end bits are ignored.
+
+- semtech,io-pullup:
+- semtech,io-pulldown: A bit-mask which enables-or disables the
+  		       pull-up (pull-down) resistor for each IO line
+  		       in the expander. Setting the bit at position n
+  		       will enable the pull-down for the IO at the
+  		       corresponding offset.  For chips with fewer
+  		       than 16 IO pins, high-end bits are ignored.
+
+- semtech,reset-during-probe: Boolean, if true, the driver will
+  			      trigger a full reset of the chip at the
+  			      beginning of the probe in order to place
+  			      it in a known state.
+
+- semtech,oscio-is-gpo: Boolean, if set to true, the driver will
+  			configure OSCIO as a GPO instead of as an
+  			oscillator, increasing the size of the GP(I)O
+  			pool created by this expander by one.  The
+  			output-only GPO pin will be added at the end
+  			of the block.
