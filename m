This patch series adds hierarchical IRQ chip support to spmi-gpio so
that device tree consumers can request an IRQ directly from the GPIO
block rather than having to request an IRQ from the underlying PMIC.

For more background information, see the email thread with Linus
Walleij's excellent description of the problem at
https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-gpio/msg34655.html.

This work was tested on a LG Nexus 5 (hammerhead) phone. My status page
at https://masneyb.github.io/nexus-5-upstream/ describes what is working
so far with the upstream kernel.

Changes since v5:
- Patch 4: Set handler to edge or level when the IRQ is mapped.
- Patch 7: Change IRQ_TYPE_NONE to IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING
- Patch 14: New patch to validate type when mapping IRQ

Changes since v4:
- Patch 3: Remove unnecessary u16 cast on device_get_match_data()
- Patch 5: Change '&struct gpiochip' in kernel doc to
  '&struct gpio_chip'

High-level changes since v3:
- Add missing variants to spmi-gpio driver and device tree binding doc
  that are already in use in device tree.
- Introduce patch that disassociates the old virq if hwirq mapping
  already exists and then drop it at the end of the series. This is to
  not break git bisect for existing boards.
- Migrate arm64 device tree files.
- There are 8 new patches in this series and I denoted this in the notes
  on the relevant patches.

High-level changes since v2:
- Dropped patch to mfd/qcom-spmi-pmic.c
- Patch 3 is new and adds two new functions to gpiolib
- Patch 6 is new and corrects the only other upstream user of spmi-gpio

High-level changes since v1:
- Patches 1 and 2 are new. This brought in a third subsystem (mfd).
- I have detailed changelogs attached to the notes on patches 3-5.
