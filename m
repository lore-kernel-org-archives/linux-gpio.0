Oh sorry man. I am clearly too stupid for this job...

In accordance with things needing to be intuitive, something named
*force_* should of course force the setting into the hardware.

The original patch didn't mention the fact that it was hogs
and hogs only that was causing the trouble and that is why I
got lost. (I guess.) I have been going about this as if it was
something generic that affect all states in all devices, and to
me hogs is just an abscure corner of pin controlling...

I applied the patchwork patch from above, and elaborated
a bit on that it pertains to hogs, let's see what
happens.

For the case where a driver (not hog) needs to handle
suspend/resume transitions, proper states can hopefully
be used.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
