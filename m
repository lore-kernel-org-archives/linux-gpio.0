I don't think that's an issue. We basically have two cases here:
either we have a driver using the pin or not.

If we have a driver using it, then pinctrl will make sure we have an
exclusive use of the pin, before the gpio is requested and we start
changing that value. If not, then no one cares anyway.

Note that the PIO is built on the same model and it works, while we
have 3 drivers in one. The only reason why we have everything linked
to the same device is because we have to share the address space, but
regmap takes care of that here.
