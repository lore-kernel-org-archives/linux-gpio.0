I think you need mainly to convince Maxime that this is something that
he wants to maintain, going forward.

I am as subsystem maintainer pretty pleased as long as standard
properties etc are used to encode the data into the devicetree, and
DT maintrainers are not actively vetoing what you do.

If it leads to a conflict between Allwinner maintainers it is not worth the
effort for reasons that are social rather than technical. To me it is a ver=
y
nice but as with all volunteer communities also very vulnerable
endavour.

Please make sure not to push your point so hard that it hurts your
our your colleagues feelings.

I know people are passionate about their ideas, which is usally good
but also scare me sometimes because they sometimes become so
passionate that it makes them bad team players.

Yours,
Linus Walleij
