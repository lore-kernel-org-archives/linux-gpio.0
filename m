Hi Rob,

Thanks for your time in reviewing this.

You are totally right, my english is not my best as you can see :-).
I'll fix this
for v2.

Actually, this is deliberate, so it will not change.

ok, thanks. I will.

Yes, that's true. Actually this is one of the things that has been
changed for v2.

Mmmm, That's what I understood from documentation:

"Some system-on-chips (SoCs) use the concept of GPIO banks. ...
Usually each such bank is
exposed in the device tree as an individual gpio-controller node. ..."

If this is not a good approach, could you please me point me out to a
device tree example where
the correct approach is being used?

Thanks in advance.
