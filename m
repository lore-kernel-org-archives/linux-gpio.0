I personally prefer explicit naming of the functions rather than putting
a bunch of flags into some parameter. If you're overly concerned about
the amount of convenience functions, perhaps the _index variants can be
left out for gpiod_get_one(). I'd argue that if drivers want to deal
with that level of detail anyway, they may just as well add the index
explicitly when calling the function.

While we're at it, gpiod_get_one() doesn't sound like a very good name.
All other variants only request "one" as well. Perhaps something like
gpiod_get_with_flags() would be a better name.

Then again, maybe rather than add a new set of functions we should bite
the bullet and change gpiod_get() (and variants) to take an additional
flags parameter. There aren't all that many users yet (I count 26
outside of drivers/gpio), so maybe now would still be a good time to do
that.
