This adds the handling locally in the driver for a certain Arizona chip.

And then the next time you have to duplicate the code again and again.

That's not working, put this in the core.

Don't use a local array for this.

This should be something like gpiochip_get_sleep_persistance(chip, offset)

> +       if (change && !(status & GPIO_SLEEP_MAY_LOOSE_VALUE)) {

That us a dt-binfings header define, that is not a Linux constant.

Add FLAG_MAY_LOOSE_VALUE_DURING_SLEEP or something in
drivers/gpio/gpiolib.h, store this inside the struct gpio_desc like all
other flags and retrieve it from there.

Augment the code in gpiolib.c and gpiolib-of.c to parse this and
store it properly in the gpio_desc and use it as described above.

Then it is reusable for others.

No need for this hackery if you move the parsing to the core, so do that.
