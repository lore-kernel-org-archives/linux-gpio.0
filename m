Not really, even if the kernel is configured as big endian, either native-endian or big-endian are needed.
The default is little-endian if nothing else is specified:

Because we want to add a simple gpio driver for these old SoCs with the newer ones having a different and more complex gpio/pinctrl driver.

Sure, I just copy & pasted this from the other gpio mmio driver:

This is the layout for BCM6345:
https://gitlab.labs.nic.cz/turris/openwrt/blob/8bfda76892a39c033b5abf2c17035a444fffad08/target/linux/brcm63xx-2.6/files/include/asm-mips/mach-bcm963xx/6345_map_part.h#L141
And this is the layout for BCM6338:
https://gitlab.labs.nic.cz/turris/openwrt/blob/8bfda76892a39c033b5abf2c17035a444fffad08/target/linux/brcm63xx-2.6/files/include/asm-mips/mach-bcm963xx/6338_map_part.h#L202

I don't think that's the case since we're using a generic mmio binding.
