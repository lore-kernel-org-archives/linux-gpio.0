+* ZTE ZX Pin Controller
+
+The pin controller on ZTE ZX platforms is kinda of hybrid.  It consists of
+a main controller and an auxiliary one.  For example, on ZX296718 SoC, the
+main controller is TOP_PMM and the auxiliary one is AON_IOCFG.  Both
+controllers work together to control pin multiplexing and configuration in
+the way illustrated as below.

+For most of pins like GMII_RXD3 in the figure, the pinmux function is
+controlled by TOP_PMM block only, and this type of pins are meant by term
+'TOP pins'.  For pins like KEY_ROW2, the pinmux is controlled by both
+TOP_PMM and AON_IOCFG blocks, as the available multiplexing functions for
+the pin spread in both controllers.  This type of pins are called 'AON pins'.
+Though pinmux implementation is quite different, pinconf is same for both
+types of pins.  Both are controlled by auxiliary controller, i.e. AON_IOCFG
+on ZX296718.
+
+Required properties:
+- compatible: should be "zte,zx296718-pmm".
+- reg: the register physical address and length.
+- zte,auxiliary-controller: phandle to the auxiliary pin controller which
+  implements pinmux for AON pins and pinconf for all pins.
+
+The following pin configuration are supported. Please refer to
+pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for more details of the common
+pinctrl bindings used by client devices.
+
+- bias-pull-up
+- bias-pull-down
+- drive-strength
+- input-enable
+- slew-rate
+
+Examples:
+
+iocfg: pin-controller@119000 {
+	compatible = "zte,zx296718-iocfg";
+	reg = <0x119000 0x1000>;
+};
+
+pmm: pin-controller@1462000 {
+	compatible = "zte,zx296718-pmm";
+	reg = <0x1462000 0x1000>;
+	zte,auxiliary-controller = <&iocfg>;
+};
+
+&pmm {
+	vga_pins: vga {
+		pins = "KEY_COL1", "KEY_COL2", "KEY_ROW1", "KEY_ROW2";
+		function = "VGA";
+	};
+};
+
+&vga {
+	pinctrl-names = "default";
+	pinctrl-0 = <&vga_pins>;
+	status = "okay";
+};
