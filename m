I don't understand the question really.

I am not an expert on this system, if the people working with it
cannot tell a function from a group I don't know who can... certainly
not me.

What I can say is that pincontrol combines functions and groups to
states using a mapping. The functions should be something you poke
into a register, the groups are looser defined but may also be a
character of the hardware, but more usual a character of the
intended electronic usecase. Groups contain 1..n pins and can
be combined with some applicable functions.

Please re-read Documentation/pinctrl.txt very closely if anything is
unclear, I really put a lot of hours into getting that right. Especially
reexamine "Pinmux conventions".

Yours,
