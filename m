Hello Linus,

It's me again, so I have been thinking about the problem originally
reported in: [PATCH fixes v3] pinctrl: Really force states during suspend/resume

and other similar patches a while ago, and this new version allows a platform
using pinctrl-single to specify whether its pins are going to lose their state
during a system deep sleep.

Note that this is still checked at the pinctrl_select_state() because consumers
of the pinctrl API might be calling this from their suspend/resume functions
and should not have to know whether the provider does lose its pin states.

This is against your pinctrl/for-next branch.

Thanks!

Changes in v2:

- make the property generic and not specific to pinctrl-single

Florian Fainelli (2):
  pinctrl: Allow a device to indicate when to force a state
  pinctrl: Allow indicating loss of pin states during low-power
