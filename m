I've been observing it since 3.16 or so, when I first got mainline=20
running on
the box. So my guess would be that it is NOT a regression.

AFAIK there's no GPL source drop for DNS-327L just yet. I'm using stock=

uboot:

U-Boot 2009.08-00043-gcfe3b76-dirty (Dec 03 2012 - 15:27:58)
Marvell version: 1.1.2 NQ.DNS-327.01

Didn't risk to burn upstream u-boot, just in case the hardware required=
=20
any
special hacks to work.
