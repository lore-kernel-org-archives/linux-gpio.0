Yes but I don't see how I can fix my issue with these levels. In my
case, I need an exclusive ownership at device level not at pin level. In
reality, it is at pin level but I am in this situation because my pin
controler was introduced as non strict and also because I need to set
the configuration of the pin which is going to be used as a GPIO.

If the ownership is exclusive, pinmuxing coming from pinctrl-default
will be accepted but the GPIO request will fail even if it comes from the
same device.

If the ownership is shared then, pinmuxing coming from pinctrl-default
will be accepted but a GPIO request from another device will be accepted
too.

Both situations are incorrect in my case.

Let me know if I have not well understood your proposal. My concern is
to get out of this situation without breaking current DTs.
