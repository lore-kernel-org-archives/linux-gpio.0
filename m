My comment was misunderstandable. What I meant was that a driver doesn't have to
use gpio_to_irq to request an interrupt, this can also be done via DT.

In request_resource we don't know the irq type yet (and therefore whether we need
one or wo parent interrupts). IMHO we can't get completely rid of allocating
parents in set_type.

Support for IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH I'd consider a mandatory feature. It's needed
e.g. by the SD card detection (drivers/mmc/slot-gpio.c).
