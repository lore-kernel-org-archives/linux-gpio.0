If the OS started to support that interface, it would need to
guarantee consistent behavior with respect to it going forward.

It would be an interface for interacting with firmware, so it is not
much different from an interface to user space as far as the stability
rules go.  Which may be a reason for refusing to support it in the
first place if the OS is not willing to make such a guarantee.

Agreed.  I actually asked Octavian to look at the other proposal and
see if/how that could be used to address the use case in question
and/or possibly extended to cover it.

Thanks,
