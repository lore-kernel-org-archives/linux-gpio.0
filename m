Not today no, that's why I said it would take some work.

Unclaimed by a proper device and driver in the driver model.

I can see that, but this still needs to be implemented properly and not
just as a quick hack on top of the already fragile gpio sysfs-interface=
=2E

Since pretty much everyone agrees that the current interface needs to b=
e
replaced, we really shouldn't be adding more stuff to the broken
interface before that happens.

Again, this is exactly how the interface has always worked, and that's
exactly how your v3, which added the attributes manually, also worked.

The group-visibility mechanism is not broken. What's broken is interfac=
e
designs based on attributes magically disappearing and reappearing afte=
r
the device has been created.
