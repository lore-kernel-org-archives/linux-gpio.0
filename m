It is though latest version was posted by Rafael a bit later:
https://lists.acpica.org/pipermail/dsd/2015-December/000027.html


In addition the core rules requiring that existing ACPI paradigms are not
subverted through DSD (basically the concern you express) are also
documented in the main DSD documentation itself:
http://www.uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/_DSD-device-properties-UU
ID.pdf (section 2.3)
