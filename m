That doesn't seem helpful though, because the assignment of the
pins is not hidden from the source file that should be documenting
it: if someone wants to know how the pins are muxed, they now have
to cross-reference the dts file with the header. If you just put the
pin number directly into the dts, it becomes completely clear
what the setting is.

The driver should not be board specific.
