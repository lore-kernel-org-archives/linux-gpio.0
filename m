ok i see, it fix in next series.

what i would like to say is it ok for me, it's better to review.

i will do one patch for enable/disable bias function, one for adding drive-strength function and one for adding G12A part.

i just add error message for drive strength because it's an optional feature, people can forget to set register part and just set pin part

so they can see why it's not working.
