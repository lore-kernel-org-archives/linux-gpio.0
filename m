Hi Linus,

Yes, it would be good to have it as a gpio+pinctrl with only pinconf, but it would show
the way on how to support external GPIO expanders using the pinctrl framework.

But it is quite challenging and needs quite some work, and actually the current state of the driver is that the OF is broken.

Would you agree to :
 - Push the minimal code to make OF work again, at least for 4.7 ?
 - Engage complete refactoring to transform it in a real gpio+pinctrl driver ?

For the dt-bindings properties, I can add the vendor prefixes ASAP.

Thanks,
Neil
