The gpio_chip is storage for the struct gpio_chip that we're using.
It allow us to create dynamically constructed struct gpio_chip based
on the template in madera_gpio_chip. See the code in madera_gpio_probe.

There are slight differences between the codecs (currently what we
care about is that they have different numbers of gpios.) and as we
still want to support pdata we also might have to change .base at
runtime.

It's possible to have multiple codecs of different type in one system
so patching the static madera_gpio_chip is not viable, we would need
different content for each codec.

As almost all members are the same, what we do is use madera_gpio_chip
as a template and copy it into the gpio_chip member of
struct madera_gpio for this codec. That becomes the struct gpio_chip
that we're actually using for this instance of this codec.
