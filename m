Yes, eventually, but the current gpio sysfs-interface does not allow for
that information to be confined to DT. It has always required knowledge
of the hardware (e.g. the pin numbers), but people eventually discovered
that those numbers may actually change.

I'm only pointing out that *that* particular quirk can be worked around
by providing different information about the hardware (e.g. the bus
topology).

IMO, the current interface should remain to be a pain to use so that
people either fix the drivers or start working on a replacement
user-space interface.

I agree with you that such properties (e.g. direction and function)
should be defined in DT. A gpio should not be exported until requested
by userspace though. This allow for the case where a userspace driver
can be used as a fall back if a kernel driver isn't available or loaded.

That will be solved by the new userspace interface. ;)
