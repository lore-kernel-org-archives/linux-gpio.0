Will fix this. Thanks.

We use the same iProc GPIO controller in various iProc SoCs. Like you 
said, the same iProc GPIO controller is then synthesized slightly 
differently in these SoCs:

In NSP, for example, the iProc GPIO controller supports multiple PINCONF 
functions except drive strength.

In an upcoming iProc chip, the iProc GPIO controller only supports GPIO 
related operations and all PINCONF related operations are supported by a 
different HW block.

The use of compatible strings "brcm,iproc-gpio-only" and 
"brcm,iproc-gpio" models the existing pinctrl-single driver:

Required properties:
- compatible : "pinctrl-single" or "pinconf-single".
"pinctrl-single" means that pinconf isn't supported.
"pinconf-single" means that generic pinconf is supported.

Note compatible string "brcm,iproc-gpio" was already accepted and merged 
upstream. I believe the current debate is that you do not think a 
compatible string of "brcm,iproc-gpio-only" should be introduced to deal 
with an iProc SoC whose GPIO controller is only used as GPIO controller 
without PINCONF functions, correct?

If so, may I suggest the following:

1. keep "brcm,iproc-gpio" for full featured iProc GPIO and PINCONF 
controller
2. Introduce "brcm,iproc-gpio-v2" for NSP, where GPIO and PINCONF 
functions are supported but drive strength specific PINCONF feature is 
disabled
3. Introduce "brcm,iproc-gpio-v3" for upcoming iProc SoCs that move the 
PINCONF support out of this GPIO controller to a completely separate HW 
block

It's my understanding that the naming of a compatible string is best 
tight to the name of the underlying HW block that it is dealing with, 
instead of the name of a SoC where the HW block belongs to. I'm 
uncertain whether this particular case falls into the same category, 
where the same GPIO controller is used but synthesized differently 
across different SoCs.

Please let me know if the above proposed naming is acceptable?

Okay.
