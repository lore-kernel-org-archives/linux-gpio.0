DT can be changed at run-time using overlays.

This way the RPi users could define their i2c-clients, or whatever buses
they choose to expose on those pins as well.

I've never suggested that we remove the current API, but *only* exposing
a totally non-restrictive interface for systems not used by school
children and hardware hackers is not sane.

You also cut out the part in my reply about continuing to allow
unrestricted access for such cases. That could still continue to be the
default (e.g. when there are no pin function names defined in DT).

And if those people ever update their DTs they could benefit from the
deterministic pin naming without loosing any flexibility too.
