Possible yes, but more complex, requireing a bigger and more complex
chunk of code to get it right. Which we don't have for Linux (I don't know
about $OS).

For 1 bank = 1 device, all callbacks etc naturally offsets to something
like 0..31 landing in (1 << offset) which makes for a simple support library.

If there is more complex calculations, more complex helper libs are
required and maybe not even worth it, ending up with more duplicated
or slightly-different code.
