Are you assuming bad faith?

I'm trying to maintain the GPIO subsystem, the problem with DT
is that there are no proper DT reviewers for stuff like this, instead
the task of reviewing DT stuff is pushed down to Linux subsystem
maintainers like me.

I think Michael made a very very nice patch series trying to make
things logical for end users, please participate in that discussion.

I don't see what you mean here. The numbers that appear in
say /proc/interrupts may seem stable but they are not.
They depend on things like probe order between irqchips
and can change between two boots.

The reason users don't have an issue with it is that there is
(thank god) no userspace ABI for interrupts.

What the Linux kernel call GPIO numbers (or IRQ numbers for that
matter) is something different from the hardware numbers in the
datasheets. To the kernel it is just some cookie number.

In the irqchip subsystem we have ->hwirq that corresponds to
whatever the datasheet says, and which appears in the second
column i /proc/interrupts, and in the GPIO subdrivers I tend to
try to use "offset" the same way, giving a local number for that
GPIO controller.

Things were simple in the past because the GPIO numberspace
was designed under the assumption that there would be only
one GPIO controller on a system, but the exploding complexity
of systems made it unmanageable.

The problem is for example if I have a SoC with a GPIO expander:
both have a GPIO line named "0". Which one wins? The SoC
because it is "more important"? This issue is all over the place
in any modern chipset. In Ux500 I have sometimes three GPIO
expanders, all three with GPIO line 0, and also a GPIO 0 on
the SoC of course. So we need to express this complexity to
userspace, not try to simplify the world.

Yours,
