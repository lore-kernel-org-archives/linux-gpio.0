I guess our disagreement came from the fact that we want the same
function to perform two different things. GPIOs are different from
regulators in that the former are really requested using a (dev,
function, index) vs. a (dev, function) tuple for regulators. I want a
convenience function to easily request all the GPIOs that match (dev,
function) so that functionally identical GPIOs can be manipulated as
an "atomic" set using the rest of the gpiod_array API (which would
make no sense for regulators which have no "index". You want an
equivalent to regulator_bulk_get() so a driver can conveniently
request all its GPIOs no matter the function they fullfil.

These should really be two different functions for two different
use-cases - gpiod_array_get() that returns an array suitable for being
manipulated using the rest of the gpiod_array API ; gpiod_bulk_get()
that takes the equivalent of regulator_bulk_data for GPIOs and fills
it the same way.
