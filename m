In my case, irq_startup() is never called for irq 305, ie. LUBBOCK_SA1111_IRQ.
See deep down the mail for the cause ...

Hmm, it never happens to me ...

Ah ok.

I think I traced that in the commit message of :
aa8d6b73ea33 ("ARM: pxa: pxa_cplds: add lubbock and mainstone IO")

The concern I had was that the former mechanism was not working anymore as the
chained handler was overwritten in gpio-pxa.c, and I wanted that gpio be
possibly probed at device initcall time.

I will check it more carefully. I remember having made tests, and cross-checked
the user manual of the Cotulla Development board, chapter 3.4 "Managing
Peripheral Interrupts", where there is no restriction on when the latched status
can be cleared.

I understand the concern that clearing the status before the interrupt source is
serviced can re-set the status during the peripheral handler, if it's a level
interrupt.

Maybe it worked so far by sheer luck, or because the ethernet card was the only
really tested interrupt.

Mmm I will check, but see 2 cat /proc/interrupts in a row :
307:       9384  pxa_cplds   3 Edge      eth0
307:       9417  pxa_cplds   3 Edge      eth0

The difference is not a multiple of 2. I will check anyway.

In the FPGA.

Ah I think I know what happens. The trick is that when this
irq_set_chained_handler_and_data() is called, the irq_desc for irq 305 is not
yet allocated (ie. is NULL). And it is not allocated because
pxa_cplds_irqs.cplds_probe() was not yet called, and had not allocated the irq
descriptors.

I would bet that on neponset the input interrupt to the SA1111 is within
0..NR_IRQS, which is not the case on lubbock anymore since the pxa_cplds_irqs
conversion.

It looks that I have an ordering problem :
 - I want gpio-pxa.probe() to be called at device initcall time
 - pxa_cplds_irqs.probe() cannot complete before gpio-pxa.probe() because it
   needs GPIO0 as its interrupt source
   => it might need to honor -EPROBE_DEFER
 - sa1111.sa1111_probe() cannot complete before pxa_cplds_irqs.probe() because
   it needs IRQ305 as its source
   => it might need to honor -EPROBE_DEFER

I fail to see how the "optimized" irq chained handler can be used in a
device-tree type build, where I don't think the probe ordering is guaranteed.

Cheers.
