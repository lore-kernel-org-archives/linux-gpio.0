I must have failed some git add command, I didn't realize they were
together until you pointed it out just now.

This has been discussed more lengthly on the netdev side but the whole
patch serie has been (quite) a bit too hasty; on one side I've been
given some interesting feedback that I would not have gotten just
sending the coccinelle patch first but I really should have waited for
that to land first and most importantly spend more time on each
individual patch, this was rude of me.

I will make sure they are split in a v2, and send them individually
(well, per big component) as self-explaining patches rather than as a
block, once the coccinelle patch has been accepted. 


Thank you for the review,
