There's large classes of hardware where it's just not generally the
default over all manufacturers - things like audio CODECs and regulators
that have to represent continuous ranges of numerical values have to
decide between a helpful representation of numbers with a non-zero
default or having a more complicated representation of numbers which
manage to make zero correspond to whatever the default value is.  It's
also quite common for booleans you want to default on.

It will actually populate the cache from I/O if you don't provide
defaults but it then can't tell what the physical defaults are, we could
read back from hardware but then we have to sync that with the hardware
being reset and if you read the whole thing back that gets super
expensive with slow buses.
