Could I know where "should translate into _one_ GPIO chip" comes from ? Is it a
specification, or is it a new rule we're creating ?

And if it's a new rule, I'd like to know what backs it up .

I was going to suggest the very same approach. If this one (or a similar one)
doesn't meet success, then my weekend of revert queries is not over ... and I
don't like reverts.
