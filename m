There is: you implement SPI using bitbang on GPIOs.

It should. Plenty of people have connected '595s to SPI buses (I did so
myself, too). Hint: connect chip select to the register clock.

Yes, it will require more code, as spi-gpio is more generic than your s=
imple
implementation.  But the end result is more flexible and reusable.

The only thing missing is the programmable OE and reset pins,
which are assumed hardwired by the gpio-74x164 driver.
These could be implemented using new gpio-oe and gpio-reset
properties.
