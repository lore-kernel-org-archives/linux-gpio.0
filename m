Hi Alexandre,

Sorry for late. Could you give me more clue about the gpiod interface?=20
Don't we also call gpio_request() which uses GPIO number to request a
GPIO?

I am now enabling GPIO in Hip04-d01. Maybe, I can just use
the default ARCH_NR_GPIOS, then users can manage GPIO through sysfs.
However if so, GPIO 0~127 will be mapped to GPIO 384~511.

Thanks for your suggestion. But setting "linux,gpio-base" will bring
gpio base implementation specific, and in face there is no place to gai=
n
this gpio base info, not appropriate both in gpio arch code and dwapb
code.

Thanks again for your comments,
