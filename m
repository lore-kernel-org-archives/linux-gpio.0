So each of them will have their own compatible, and table entry,
so what's the problem? If they don't have their own compatible,
they should be added, because they are per definition not compatible
if they need different values into different parts of the register.

Yes because the DT maintainers do not like that we use the device
tree as a data dumping ground.

pinctrl-single.c and some other real big pin controllers are dumping
data into the device tree, but it is a dubious practice. Two wrongs
doesn't make one right.

But you will have to patch the driver to add a new compatible for each
platform you're upstreaming anyway, so this isn't going to make things
easier.
