As mentioned in other e-mails in this thread I don't think this should be 
split out to a separate driver, I would move the functionality to the 
ds90ux9xx driver. You may want to register an I2C mux, but as you have a 
single port, that could be overkill. I haven't studied in details how to best 
support this chip using the existing I2C subsystems APIs (which we may want to 
extend if it needed), but I believe that (in your use cases) the deserializer 
should be a child of the serializer, and modeled as an I2C device.
