No dead code please. I think that is just confusing.

OK.

Having multiple syscons is not a problem.

I don't understand this. Can you explain? If another driver is using
a non-syscon pattern then surely it can be refactored due to being
done the wrong way in the first place. I have done so myself when
running into similar issues.
