I agree that if that's the case then it should be documented. Currently
by reading the docs there is no way to tell if -gpio was only added to
support old DT bindings and should not be used or if is that the docs
were not updated when <function>-gpio parsing was added to gpiolib.

I can re-spin the patch making it clear that even when the -gpio suffix
is supported, it's only there for compatibility reasons and should not
be used for newer bindings.

And also Documentation/gpio/board.txt has to be updated now since now it
mentions <function>-gpio but does not say that should not be used.
