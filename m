Yes, for most scenarios, it can work with the "sleep" state to set
sleep-related config. But for our Spreadtrum platform scenario (I do
not know if there are other platforms need this feature), we can not
select the "sleep" state when pubcp system goes into deep sleep mode
but ap system does not go into deep sleep mode. So I think we still
need these "sleep-bias-pull-up", "sleep-bias-pull-down",
"sleep-input-enable" and "sleep-output-enable" properties.
