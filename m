Linus,

Ludovic sent this series nearly one month ago. It was posted after a RF=
C
series on the same topic two months ago. As we don't see any comment on
neither of them we assume that it's okay to include them.

So, is it possible for you to merge these 2 patches in
pinmux/pinconf-generic? The driver making use of this work, which was
marked a "PROTO" in the series sent by Ludovic, is being finalized and
sent: it would be good to have it working early.

Best regards,
