No can you point it out?

It's too late because they are already in the devel branch
and mixed up with merged of *other* immutable stuff.

However I think it is plain wrong to try to keep any bisectability
between the kernel at large and arch/*/boot/dts/*, because
the DTS stuff is supposed to at some point be maintained outside
of the kernel and for all OSes, they simply shouldn't be sync:ed.

Yours,
