Ok this is your opinion. I don't share it. Keeping function names tidy is good,
I don't think we need another macro to do so.

I don't see how adding a macro doing just string concatenation is going to make
anything more clean. It does not prevent one to write FUNCTION_EX(uart_ao_b,
_gpioz), resulting in uart_ao_b_gpioz, which is what is apparently considered
'not clean'

BTW, there no cleanness issue here, the name is just out of the 'usual scheme'
but there is no problem with. If you want to change this, and
s/uart_ao_b_gpioz/uart_ao_b_z/, now is the time to change it.
