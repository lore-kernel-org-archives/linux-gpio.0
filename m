I think it depends on how you see it. Based on this logic, then one can
also argue comments in the code will be pre-processed away and are not
needed. They at least serve the same documentation purpose in a way. So
far I haven't seen other people complaining that having these module
based macros in the driver are confusing when the Kconfig has a bool.
