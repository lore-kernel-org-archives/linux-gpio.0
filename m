How can we just check that? And what was the problem with CF IRQs?
Sorry, if I'm asking dumb questions, I really missed that part of the history.

I can go the way Linus Walleij originally did:
1) switch to irq domain / hwirq
2) integrate static variables to containers

And only after that in a separate patch(set)

3) Move GPIO IRQ handling to gpio-sa1100.

What do you think?

Thus I have the big FIXME.

I see. I will put this back in the next iteration, but see below please.

I thought so. I was puzzled, because that would mean, that we want to wake
up from a GPIO, which is masked in GPIO_IRQ_mask, but enabled in PWER.
Is that the real scenario/usecase? If we/kernel has disabled IRQ
through _mask_irq,
I thought, we didn't expect events from that pin (including wakeup), did we?
