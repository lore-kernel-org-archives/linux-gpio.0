No, I was reacting to the NAK (which I can accept) that does not
address or even acknowledge the problem (which I cannot accept so
easily).

But now that a solution has appeared, I am happy again.

Yes, I read it, and it sounds like it will solve the problem.  I will
give the series a try...

I was talking about CONFIG_IRQ_DOMAIN_DEBUG.

Thanks for the explanation.  Of course I don't want an arbitrarily
simplified interface, but I can't understand why the simple case of
built-in SoC GPIOs must have such a weird and variable numbering
patterns.

But once user space can call GPIOs by name, then it doesn't matter
anymore what the kernel numbers are.

Thanks,
Richard
