I definately want feedback from Maxime before I do anything with

I don't understand what this adds that gpio-ranges does not already
provide.
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt
at the end of the file.

These ranges exist exactly to map pin controller pins in a pin controller
to GPIO lines in a gpiochip.

We have recently added GPIO "bank" awareness into gpiolib
via Thierry Reding's patches, so a gpiochip can use the generic
GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP and specify multiple IRQ parents with a map.

Please see if you can use this instead.

If any of this should be expressed in the DT bindings it should
be genericized and not use any "allwinner,*" prefixes, and it
should preferably just be hard-coded in the driver and switched
in from the compatible string IMO.

I don't understand this. It looks hacky. Can you elaborate why this
is needed?

I guess it is a bool flag?

This is a standard bindings so I don't have much against it. But I
need Maxime's input here, I think we should keep Allwinner consistent
across SoCs.
