It's not the missing OE support in gpio-74x164 that worries me, but
the whole rest.

I would need to modify gpio-74x164 to:
1) Use another OF table with different entry
2) Use different probe function that doesn't take spi_device parameter
and doesn't do spi setup
3) Extend struct gen_74x164_chip to include GPIOs
4) Use totally different __gen_74x164_write_config

Amount of shared code would be so small I doubt it's worth it. Both
driver are quite trivial (200 or less LOC). Sharing:
1) ~5 lines long __gen_74x164_write_config
2) ~5 lines long gen_74x164_set_value
3) 1 line long gen_74x164_direction_output
makes me feel it's not really worth combining these two drivers into a =
one.
