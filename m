I see your point. It would be good to keep the behavior consistent with
what would be expected by the user -- and adding an additional AND
operation at the end to mask away the unrequested bits should not really
affect the performance to a discernible degree -- so I'll submit a
patchset implementing the mask for these drivers some time this weekend.
