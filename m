Hi Baolin!

Thank you for your patch.

Are they four sub-modules that are always synthesized into the
silicon at the same time, or do you mean that when producing the
hardware, the designer will choose one of these four types (it looks
like that from the example).

I don't understand the last part, do you mean the signal will be ignored
if it is asserted for less than 1 ms?

Do you mean "microsecond granularity"?

What is MCU? I think you can just omit it, it could be integrated
elsewhere.

Do you mean that the EIC-sync module is a synchronized signal input
register? Please write that.

So it looks like there is one at the time, so in the SC9860
all four modules exist, but at different addresses?

So does this mean that this is a debounced-only EIC?

There are latch, async and sync versions somewhere else in
memory? Or there could be? And they are never say debounce
and latch at the same time? Etc?
