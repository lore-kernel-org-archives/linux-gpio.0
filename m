Oh the pain. I am so ambivalent of this patch as it obfuscates
some stuff about the hardware that the driver should know,
while at the same time being elegant in a way.

What does the ARM SoC maintainers think about this approach?

Arnd, Olof, Kevin: is this something you'd like to see deployed?

Yours,
