That sounds good too. The diff was really noisy because all the
foo[i] became foo[gpio] which causes the diff to increase for no
real purpose. My patch was rewriting that stuff so it doesn't
come into the diff and we can concentrate on what's actually
changing. We already iterate over the full range to fill in the
two fields anyway, so I'm not sure what you're getting at with
your for-loop comment. Seems like a micro-optimization on probe
that probably isn't going to be noticed.

Yeah I wouldn't do that. I'm not trying to avoid allocating the
array anymore. Dynamically sized arrays on the stack are not a
great idea in the kernel where we have limited stack sizes.
