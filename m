In both versions, these sizes create overlapping resources. Don't do that.

You could fix it with a size of 0xC, but I think that is overkill.
Just put the knowledge that the bank stride is 0xC in the driver and
do a single node. Otherwise you end up with 3 mappings to the same
address or complex parsing code to avoid that.

Unless the h/w is really so configurable that it could be any sets of
addresses, just describe the base address. If the number of banks is
configurable, then add a property for that.
