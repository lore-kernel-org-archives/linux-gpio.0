FPS: Flexible Power Sequence.
Max77620 has three FPS source configuration FPS0,1 2 and can be 
configured with different digital input signals EN0, EN1 and EN2.
Then rails and few GPIOs can configured with these FPS SRC with 
different slots so that it can be controlled externally.

When FPS_SRC is set to NONE (this is needed from platform data) then 
based on constraint like boot enable/always enable, it need to be on 
desired state. Otherwise we may endup with disabling the rail when 
setting to NONE and create issue.

I need to set the FPS src properly for each rails before callback happen 
from regulator init so that enable/disable/is_enable can handle it properly.

Here, init data is not needed. I was thinking to configure slew rate in 
preinit but can be done later also through regulator->ops.
But I will need the driver specific DT data (customized flag) to 
configure the PMIC like slots.
