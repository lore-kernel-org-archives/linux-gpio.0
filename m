That can be added on later when/if we add support for
mapping pins to userspace.

If you know you want to give it to userspace and how to set
it up properly you certainly know what to name it too, so for
pins explicitly exported to userspace we need a mechanism
to name them and export them explicitly (without having userspace
exporting them to itself with that brain-damaged sysfs interface).
