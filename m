This is rather straight forward and rather simple for controller intern=
al GPIO=20
controllers but when using GPIO expanders both on SPI and I2C thing wil=
l get=20
much more volatile especially on SMP systems. What would be the correct=
=20
"order" here? Unless they are cascaded they are independent and there i=
s no=20
such thing as an order. Probe order _is_ unpredictable so they will var=
y on=20
different boots. Having 4 internal GPIO controllers which creates 4 gpi=
ochips=20
with more or less fixed names is rather a special case. Dunno if they m=
ight=20
change on a SMP system. Can a driver probe be called multiple times=20
simultaneously? Well, when drivers are used as modules I think things a=
re even=20
more unpredictable.

Given the fact that hardware names and gpiochip number relation is not =
fixed=20
IMHO the simplest way to identify them is using the DT label. You need =
them=20
anyway to identify them in DT itself at other places why not using this=
 on=20
Linux userspace too? So gpiochip[0-9]* should still be created but usin=
g udev=20
you can create appropriate symlinks with more recognizable names.
