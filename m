So why not make them comments? And even that might not be needed:
- MODULE_LICENSE() only summarizes, in just a few words, what takes a
few paragraphs in the customary comment at the top of a file;
- MODULE_DESCRIPTION() repeats what, in general, has been said in the
Kconfig entry for that driver and in the git commit explanation;
- and I'm not sure what the benefit is of MODULE_AUTHOR() in the first
place (even for actually modular drivers).

Perhaps that's just because review doesn't spot all issues. Patch
bandwidth exceeding review bandwidth and all that.

Anyhow, right now there's another thread discussing the questions my
review comments raise. Eg, "The Kconfig symbol is bool, there is module
related code in the driver, why note make the Kconfig symbol tristate
(and the driver modular)?". I think that is one of the questions mixing
built-in and modular semantics raises.
