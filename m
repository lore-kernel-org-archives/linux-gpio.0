I would sure prefer to have these in the generic core where this patch
puts them. I don't see the problem with that. We have to start generic
code from some point.

Yeah. I was however thinking about that we should create a helper
library for port-mapped IO along the lines of gpio-mmio.c so we might
as well get started with that in that case, just call it gpio-port-mapped-io.c
and put these in first or something.
