Make it possible to name the producer side of a GPIO line using
a "gpio-line-names" property array, modeled on the
"clock-output-names" property from the clock bindings.

This naming is especially useful for:

- Debugging: lines are named after function, not just opaque
  offset numbers.

- Exploration: systems where some or all GPIO lines are available
  to end users, such as prototyping, one-off's "makerspace usecases"
  users are helped by the names of the GPIO lines when tinkering.
  This usecase has been surfacing recently.

The gpio-line-names attribute is completely optional.

Example output from lsgpio on a patched Snowball tree:

GPIO chip: gpiochip6, "8000e180.gpio", 32 GPIO lines
        line  0: unnamed unused
        line  1: "AP_GPIO161" "extkb3" [kernel]
        line  2: "AP_GPIO162" "extkb4" [kernel]
        line  3: "ACCELEROMETER_INT1_RDY" unused [kernel]
        line  4: "ACCELEROMETER_INT2" unused
        line  5: "MAG_DRDY" unused [kernel]
        line  6: "GYRO_DRDY" unused [kernel]
        line  7: "RSTn_MLC" unused
        line  8: "RSTn_SLC" unused
        line  9: "GYRO_INT" unused
        line 10: "UART_WAKE" unused
        line 11: "GBF_RESET" unused
        line 12: unnamed unused

ChangeLog v3->v4:
- Do not use the bool accessor to see if a line is there, use
  the return value from counting the strings to bail out if
  <= 0.
- Augment the naming loop to be smarter.
- Merging this now as there is no further feedback from the DT
  people in weeks.
ChangeLog v2->v3:
- Swap "gpio-names" for "gpio-line-names" as "gpio-names" indicate
  a consumer endpoint in DT terminology.
- Index to either:
  (A) The end of the gpio-names array or
  (B) ngpios
  So we don't risk going out of bounds on either
ChangeLog v1->v2:
- Make the naming function return void: we continue at all times
  and always return 0 anyway.
- Fix a return value check.

This has been discussed at some length now.

Why we are not using hogs: these are consumer side, not producer
side. The gpio-controller in DT (gpio_chip in Linux) is a
producer, not a consumer.

This patch is not about assigning initial values to GPIO lines.
That is an orthogonal usecase. This is just about naming lines.

+Optionally, a GPIO controller may have a "gpio-line-names" property. This is
+an array of strings defining the names of the GPIO lines going out of the
+GPIO controller. This name should be the most meaningful producer name
+for the system, such as a rail name indicating the usage. Package names
+such as pin name are discouraged: such lines have opaque names (since they
+are by definition generic purpose) and such names are usually not very
+helpful. For example "MMC-CD", "Red LED Vdd" and "ethernet reset" are
+reasonable line names as they describe what the line is used for. "GPIO0"
+is not a good name to give to a GPIO line. Placeholders are discouraged:
+rather use the "" (blank string) if the use of the GPIO line is undefined
+in your design. The names are assigned starting from line offset 0 from
+left to right from the passed array. An incomplete array (where the number
+of passed named are less than ngpios) will still be used up until the last
+provided valid line index.
