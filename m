Agreed, would be relatively doable for regulators, might be a bit
verbose for the clock, but I really don't see how to handle
pinctrl.

I guess I will wait and see what the other maintainers think but
personally I would really be inclined to keep the binding the
same as the last version if we can.

Thanks,
