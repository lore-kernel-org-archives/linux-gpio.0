I should have replied one month ago, but if gpiolib is disabled, how
can we use gpiolib-like logic to check the existence of a GPIO?

Having GPIO disabled means there is no GPIO support, including the
ability to look for GPIOs. -ENOSYS is a well-documented error-code
which meaning also applies to the gpio_*_optional functions (we don't
have support for the operation you requested). If a driver or
architecture really, really needs GPIO support they can require or
depend on CONFIG_GPIOLIB, and the problem goes away. If they can work
with and without gpiolib, then they should check for -ENOSYS when they
request GPIOs and behave accordingly.

Moving the interpretation of what the absence of gpiolib means down to
the GPIO functions themselves is actually what might lead consumers to
not know the result of their request. For this reason I would say that
-ENOSYS is appropriate here.
