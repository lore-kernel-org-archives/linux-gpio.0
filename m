I will be available to test the new driver, once submitted
on the mailing list.

As a temporary solution, locally I reverted the following
commits to be able to have a working platform on 4.9-rc1:
* "gpio: of: factor out common code to a new helper function"
  (99468c1af913bb5662c223b68e783b4bf9200184)
* "gpio: of: remove of_gpiochip_and_xlate() and struct gg_data"
  (762c2e46c0591d207289105c8718e4adf29b2b34)
