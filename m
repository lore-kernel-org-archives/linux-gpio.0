Ok, so i guess you're actually fixing two different things: the first
one is that some interrupts are using the wrong function, while some
others are just not there at all. It would be great if you could make
two different patches for these.

I guess we could also change SUNXI_FUNCTION_IRQ to enforce the mux
value 6, since you're removing the last users of a different value,
but that can be done as a followup

That's a great explanation overall, it should just be in the commit
log itself. A git commit is easy to find, the discussion that was
triggered by it not so much.

Thanks!
