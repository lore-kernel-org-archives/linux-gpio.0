No, I refused to do that. If his patches get merged, Mani offered that
he will take care of rebasing/rewriting S500 part.

My biggest problem was/is that Mani designed his structs totally
different from mine, with no explanation why or how they correlate.

Also I had protested against him defining fake pins for the drive
strength. Since I did not have time to review the newer patches yet,
please make sure that this is addressed _before_ merging. Changing the
binding after the fact is a problem!

Andreas
