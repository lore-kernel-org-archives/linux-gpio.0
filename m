I still don't think this is the way to go. If you can justify that
these sub-devices require their own node, then they should have a
compatible string. The MFD sub-system will then populate the of_node
for you and you can use/request them in the normal way.

To reiterate, Mark's issue was not the existence of the compatible
string, it was with the existence of the child nodes in general.

Personally I think the device should have sub-nodes. It's how  we
dealt with our DB8500 and AB8500 and it works very well. At the end of
the day these all-in-one chips do house very different devices. I see
no harm in describing them that way. I'm sure other OSes can make use
of the sub-devices in similar ways.
