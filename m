I tried to discuss my ideas and issues with the gpio-switch bindings
already some time ago, unfortunately the discussion didn't proceed:

This patch is just about defining that we can give GPIO lines names. In=

the best case this name refers to the line name on the schematic. In th=
e
worst case it is some arbitrary name. In both cases it should not
influence any driver that is trying to use this GPIO.

gpio-hogging indeed could cause problems for future drivers as these
GPIOs are not available for any drivers. But gpio-hogging is already
defined for quite some time in the DT bindings.
Also I would assume that for most new drivers new DT bindings are
created so that it already requires a DT update together with a kernel
update.

This last sentence was only moved a bit. So perhaps this should be
changed in a separate patch.

Thanks, will remove it.
