I see. Thanks for clarifing this.

Ok, so... does the following single node sounds acceptable?

gpio: gpio@600 {
  #gpio-cells = <2>;
  #interrupt-cells = <2>;
  compatible = "mediatek,mt7621-gpio";
  gpio-controller;
  interrupt-controller;
  reg = <0x600 0x60>;
  interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
  interrupts = <GIC_SHARED 12 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
  mediatek,gpio-bank-widths = <32 32 32>;
}

Changing definition for "reg" and adding a new one for 
"mediatek,gpio-bank-widths" as follows:

reg: 
  Define the base and range of the address space containing
  the mediatek GPIO controller registers

mediatek,gpio-bank-widths:
  Number of GPIO lines for each bank.  Number of elements must
  correspond to number of banks suggested by the 'reg' property.

Thanks in advance.
