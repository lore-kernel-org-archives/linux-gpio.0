Yeah the switch back to 256 was a mistake on my end (I think I
grabbed an incorrect version for my base). ARCH_NR_GPIOs
is the total number in the system which may be multiple
chips so yes we would be possibly allocating more space
than necessary.

unsigned long fastpath[2 * BITS_TO_LONGS(FASTPATH_NGPIO)]

unsigned long fastpath[2 * BITS_TO_LONGS(512)]
unsigned long fastpath[2 * DIV_ROUND_UP(512, 8 * sizeof(long))]

so we end up with 128 bytes on the stack total assuming I
can do math correctly. I think this a fairly reasonable
amount though, even if we are over-estimating if there are
multiple chips.

Thanks,
Laura
