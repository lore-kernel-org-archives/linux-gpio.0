I don't believe this is the case.  From C99, section 6.5.3.3, paragraph 5:

The result of the logical negation operator ! is 0 if the value of its
operand compares unequal to 0,  1 if the value of its operand compares
equal to 0. The result has type int.

Thus, it's defined that !!(bool_var) and !!(int_var) will return an
int that is either 0 or 1.  This has always been part of the C
standard and I have a very hard time believing that a future standard
will change that.  It would break so much code to do so and I don't
the case for what it will improve.

So I don't see the point in changing:
!!value << SHIFT;
into:
unsigned int temp_val;
if (value)
   temp_val = 1 << SHIFT;
else
   temp_val = 0;

The former is shorter and simpler and completely defined by the C standard.
