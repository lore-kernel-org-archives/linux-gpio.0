That can be solved in the interrupt chip driver. The fact the previous
attempt didn't work doesn't mean that it's impossible.

Well, that's just an example of hacking around something in a board file
that should have been fixed in the GPIO/IRQ controller.

Really? I thought this patch was error-checking to make sure that
different drivers didn't request a GPIO and an IRQ that are actually the
same signal. This patch shouldn't affect any functionality except in
cases where there's a bug in the DT (incorrect GPIO/IRQ passed to some
driver).
