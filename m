True. I originally hadn't realized that __of_parse_phandle_with_args()
does already return the node and so started to add that feature, then
forgot to re-write the commit description. How about:

-----
of: call __of_parse_phandle_with_args from of_parse_phandle

The simplest case of __of_parse_phandle_with_args() now implements the
semantics of of_parse_phandle(). Rewrite of_parse_phandle() to call
__of_parse_phandle_with_args() rather than open-coding the simple case.

I think the overhead is pretty minimal. The main difference is that the
new code will loop over the property cell by cell rather than directly
jump into the required index. That's not likely to be much work for
typical properties. In particular, no extra DT property lookups are
performed, since of_parse_phandle() passes in cells_name=NULL,
cell_count=0, so the cells_name property is not looked up.

Besides, Grant told me to do this change:-)
