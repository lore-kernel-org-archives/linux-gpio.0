I have seen the same need beyond strictly embedded (MinnowBoard)
from the Intel camp.

These chips with funny Atom-specific codenames (baytrail, cherryview,
broxton, sunrisepoint etc) are not just used for these IoT use cases
but also for e.g. laptops of the ChromeBook form factor, and the same
pin control needs arise there, just at a different cadence related to
product cycle.

I bet they also have funny product-specific kernel trees :(

Agree: work is needed here. It is a big confusion, the whole model is
based around the configuration being pretty static as I recently
realized when just wanting to add a runtime-detected LCD panel
to a certain driver. No runtime patching of the DT or overlays or any
of the sort deliver what is really needed.

The only thing I heard which was actually doing something sensible
was when Matthew Garret once told that apple mice provide a
device tree fragment to the OS on how to handle it during bus
discovery.

I think that for random complex hotpluggable devices like what
greybus is trying to achieve this is needed too, despite the standard
USB-like device classes in all their glory.

See my previous mail for some kind of answer to this.
