Looks really nice to me and it's great that you use my patch as basis.
Looks like it works for more people than just me :)
I hope we can convince Linus to take that patch more or less as is. Eve=
n
though "kludgy" I don't see an easy way for addressing Linus' comments
without breaking current users of the interface. It may be easier/bette=
r
to gradually migrate to the newly defined bindings and remove the
kludgyness as user that rely on the current behavior disappear.

	Thanks,
