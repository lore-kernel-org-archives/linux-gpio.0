What level of access control is implemented here? Is there access
control for each GPIO individually, or is it done by banks of GPIOs?
Just asking to make sure I understand the problem domain.

Heh, I just went down the same thought process on the naming before I
read the above. Yes I agree. The property name should have something
like "reserved" in it. I vote for "gpio-reserved-ranges" because it
puts the binding owner (gpio) at the front of the name, it indicates
that the list is unavailable GPIOs, and that the format is a set of
ranges.

The fiddly bit is it assumes the GPIOs are described by a single
number. It works fine as long as the GPIO controllers can use a single
cell to describe a gpio number (instead of having #gpio-cells = 3 with
the first cell being bank, the second being number in bank, and the
third being flags).

I certainly would prefer parsing this in common code, and not in
individual drivers, but again it becomes hard for any driver using
multiple cells to describe the local GPIO number. I think the guidance
here needs to be that the property is relevant when the internal GPIO
number representation fits within a uint32, which realistically should
never be a problem.
