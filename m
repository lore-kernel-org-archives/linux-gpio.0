I mostly mean the latter. Even if the OS is in charge of _when_ those happen,
that only solves mutual exclusion over the pinctrl registers. That does not
handle expectations regarding the current _state_ of the pinctrl configuation,
or the configurations the OS/FW can permit and/or require (e.g. there's no
refcounting between OS and FW for the state of shared pins).

It may also be that pinctrl gets altered in the background (e.g. in SMM),
outside of the OS's control also, but that's probably a rare/extreme case.

Because there are clear demonstrable cases why FW would want to touch pinctrl
today, that may clash with the pinctrl model you are importing from DT (where
the OS is assumed to have complete ownership and control over pinctrl).

The ACPI model implies FW-driven pinctrl management, so if we're going to put
the OS in direct control of pinctrl, we have to make clear what expectation FW
and OS can have.

Potentially. In that case it's not clear what the FW is expected to do, and
what the OS is expected to do.

For things like system suspend/resume or hibernate, it's not clear what state
the FW is expected to save/restore, and what state might arbitrarily change.

Sure, but that is not part of the usual, automatic management of the system.

There are plenty of ways a user with sufficient privilege can bring easily down
a system. They are irrelevant.

Thanks,
Mark.
