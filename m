Eight kernel releases, including two long-term stable kernels (4.4 and
4.9), is a long time for people start using these flags and without us
finding out about it for a while still.

I have a customer who was bitten by this after updating to 4.12, and I'm
sure there will be others.

So I wouldn't simply dismiss it as theoretical.

I agree. And the interface needed to be fixed. But for next time,
perhaps being more explicit about the implications for current users
would help people notice such changes when they do happen. Backporting a
fix for a broken interface could also be considered (at least if
discovered in the next kernel release cycle or so).

And in this particular case, it looks like it might have been possible
to pick flags in such a way that the breakage could have be avoided in
the first place.
