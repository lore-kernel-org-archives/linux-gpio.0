The way I see it, GPIO mappings (whether they are done using the
lookup tables, DT, or ACPI) should only care about details that are
relevant to the device layout and that should be abstracted to the
driver (e.g. whether the GPIO is active low or open drain) so drivers
do not need to check X conditions every time they want to drive the
GPIO.

Direction and initial value, on the other hand, are clearly properties
that ought to be set by the driver itself. Thus my expectation here
would be that the driver sets the GPIO direction and initial value as
soon as it gets it using gpiod_direction_output(). In other words,
there is no replacement for gpio_request_one() with the gpiod
interface. Is there any use-case that cannot be covered by calling
gpiod_direction_output() right after gpiod_get()? AFAICT this is what
gpio_request_one() was doing anyway.
