Linus,

Thanks for your review!

Well so the chip is an FPGA, so in theory you can connect any logic
inside to (almost)
any ball on the outside (at design time). In our case we have a
daughter-board slot that gives
different meanings to what I call DB_1-DB_120. The pinctrl chip is a
soft-core in that FPGA.
Are you suggesting to use the balls of the FPGA as pin names instead?

I'll submit a patchset separately, seems like a good idea.

Thanks for the pointer, I'll take a look.

Will do.

While testing I found some more (minor) issues, that I'll need to iron out
before I submit a real patch. In my cover letter I had a question about
how to deal with a situation where I'm exclusively either input or output,
Any suggestions on the correct semantics for expressing that?
The documentation seems to indicate that 'input-enable' *must not* influence
the output of a pin. How do I reconfigure a output to no longer be an output?

Cheers,

Moritz
