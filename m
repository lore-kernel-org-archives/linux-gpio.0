To put more context, this patch is just the port of what is currently
done in gpio-mvebu.c.

I needed this support for the SD detect pin and didn't have any issue
because it was not an intensive use at all.

Going back to your concern, yes if the interrupt frequency is too high
we might loose 2 events. But the same things could happen with a single
edge, we can still miss an event.  But I agree that with the "both edge"
mode then we will loose 2 events instead of one.

It is the problem for the edge interrupt in general. So as soon as you
use edge interrupt you must be ready to loose some interrupt.

In the end I don't think it is a problem.
