Right, but by the time I left ST in 2012, mainline clock's DT support
wasn't there and the SPEAr core team got fired soon after that. No one
was left in ST to do the porting, but there are still people using the
SPEAr boards and there are products in market, so we can't delete the
platform as well.

So, no one is going to add clock DT support now.

Okay, will send a patch for that then.
