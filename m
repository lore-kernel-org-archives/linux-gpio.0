If this was entirely true, then the driver should end up only executing
[devm_]gpiochip_add_data() but that does not seem to be the case.

You are still registering a pin controller, right? Just disabling some of
the pin config options. The pin multiplexing is still there, right?
Then it is not "solely a GPIO controller". Not at all.

This patch set needs some elaboration I think.
