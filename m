Subject: [PATCH v4 0/6] Add drive-strength in Meson pinctrl driver

The purpose of this patchset is to add drive-strength support in meson pinconf
driver. This is a new feature that was added on the g12a. It is critical for us
to support this since many functions are failing with default pad drive-strength.

The value achievable by the SoC are 0.5mA, 2.5mA, 3mA and 4mA and the DT property
'drive-strength' is expressed in mA.
So this patch add another generic property "drive-strength-uA". The change to do so
would be minimal and could be benefit to other platforms later on.

Cheers
Guillaume

Changes since v3:
- remove dev_err in meson_get_drive_strength
- cleanup code

Changes since v2:
- update driver-strength-uA property to be compliant with DT documentation
- rework patch series for better understanding
- rework set_bias function

Changes since v1:
- fix missing break
- implement new pinctrl generic property "drive-strength-uA"
