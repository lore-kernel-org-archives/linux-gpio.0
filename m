It's the list of available physical GPIOs.  Here's the table:

Name (_DSD, Package ()
{
	ToUUID("daffd814-6eba-4d8c-8a91-bc9bbf4aa301"),
	Package ()
	{
		// Expose only the qdss_tracedata pins as GPIOs,
		// numbered sequentially, so that "gpio X" maps
		// to qdss_tracedata[X].  These pins are configured
		// as GPIOs (function 0) and wired externally
		// to a header on the board, so it's safe to
		// expose them to the HLOS driver.
		Package (2) {"gpios", Package ()
			{116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123,
			 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131,
			 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89,
			 90, 50, 36, 37, 38, 39}}
	}
})

Not easily, as it requires recompiling the ACPI tables.  I also don't 
know how much control customers have over the XPU settings.  The XPU is 
supposed to block access to any GPIOs that have been muxed to other 
purposes, but it's a hand-crafted list that could be anything.

Is that not what my driver is doing?  Or do I misunderstand you?

Instead of a flag, I was thinking if npins == 0, then this GPIO should 
be disabled.

This is what triggered the problem in the first place.  Every time the 
kernel boots, it's queries all of the GPIOs.  Ironically, I created that 
feature because on server platforms, that was the only way to know the 
current setting.
