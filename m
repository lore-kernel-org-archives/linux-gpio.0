I don't generally like this.

In device tree it is the consumer that specifies how the line is used,
not the producer (gpiochip).

We currently only specify polarity, open drain and open source
for consumers though.

And the entire pin control system came into being *exactly* because
Grant didn't like me adding these things to the GPIO drivers.

So how many other things does the MCP support? Drive strength?
Schmitt trigger? Is there a datasheet?

Yours,
Linus Walleij
