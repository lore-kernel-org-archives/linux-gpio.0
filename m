That code is quite necessary, because that is what makes us bind to the
correct gpio chip.  The wrong gpio chips' xlate() return an error code
and the code in of_gpiochip_find_and_xlate() makes sure we look through
the rest of the chips in the OF node until we find the right one.

But the xlate function can change the order as you suggest and use
of_gpio_simple_xlate() as a helper.  I'll make it do that.
