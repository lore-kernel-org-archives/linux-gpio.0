But also H3 and A64 are closely related, still having a totally
different sunxi name.
I guess we could give examples and counter-examples for hours, and just
making it possible to have two contradicting rationales lets me think
this whole naming scheme is inconsistent ;-)
I see that it may have fulfilled a purpose in the past (sun3i-sun7i,
maybe sun8i), but I am not very happy with proliferating this into the
(arm64) future.
Allwinner A<something> is a perfectly google-able and well understood
naming, also unique. So why add some mysterious sun{4,5,6,7,8,9,50}i to=
 it?
So I will amend identifiers/filenames where the name was just A64,
without any Allwinner reference (like in the pinctrl driver). I am in
for using sunxi as a shorthand for Allwinner, since this is a) shorter,
b) is already all over the kernel and c) doesn't give direct credit to =
a
company that apparently doesn't care ;-)

I completely agree on that, but this is in
arch/arm64/boot/dts/allwinner, so it's pretty unique. Other vendors in
there seem to think the same. I also see that just an "a" as a prefix i=
s
pretty short, so should we go with "aw" instead?
But actually I would just leave it as it is.

And I still don't get this: in the DT compatible scheme we always have =
a
vendor prefix, so allwinner,a64 is surely not a mysterious ARM Ltd. cor=
e
or a new Apple SoC. Instead it is the A64 from Allwinner, full stop. So
why should we add an arbitrary and confusing sun50i naming to it (when
it actually should be more like "sun8i-a64").

Cheers,
Andre.
