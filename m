Right, so this is the kind of description that would be nice with the
declaration.

My bad, that is for v4.4-rc1 line 694. The lines are:

So, if we have a config->of_node it is used over config->dev->of_node.

I don't see that, config->dev->of_node is checked for the init data in
regulator_of_get_init_data, then config->of_node is then ignored if that
succeeds.
