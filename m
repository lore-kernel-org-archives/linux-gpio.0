It took me quite some time to understand what the patch does.  Before I
gave specific comments on your implementation, I would discuss if there
is a better solution, as I do not like the idea of encoding these
artificial pin id of LPSR pads in the input_val.

Ideally, the LPSR controller should be implemented as a second instance
of IOMUXC.  But the problem seems to be the select input register is
shared between these two instances.  Is my understanding correct?

How select input register is shared?  With different bits in a single
register which is only laid on normal IOMUXC controller?

I need more details to understand the problem.
