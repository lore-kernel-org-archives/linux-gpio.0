Well it sure does look a lot like my patch :-). Apologies
something must have gone wrong on one of our ends as I don't
seem to have ever received your usual confirmation email it
was merged. I will try to keep a closer eye on people's trees
in future.

No changes in this version, was just updating other patches in the
chain for some feedback so no harm done. Will send an incremental
patch for comment style.

Thanks,
Charles
