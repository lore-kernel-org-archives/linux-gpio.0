Actually, I wanted to test ".free" callback function of gpio_irq_domain 
in STM32 pinctrl driver. To do that I modified gpio driver: just after 
getting virq through gpio_to_irq, I called "irq_dispose_mapping(virq)".
I know it is dirty but I thought it was the only way to test.

Doing that, I see that ".free" callback of gpio domain is called but as 
it is hirerchical ".free" callback for parent domain (exti one) is also 
called. I observed that virq was well unmapped, but not masked at exti 
level. It is for this reason than I added 
"irq_gc_mask_clr_bit(data->parent_data);" which mask interrupt at exti 
level.

Maybe this use case can never happen ? (and in this case all this stuff 
is not needed)

This Exti domain is parent of stm32 gpio domain. When ".free" callback 
of stm32 gpio domain is called then ".free" callback of Exti domain will 
be automatically called. Those both ".free" callbacks are called with 
"virq". This virq is created through stm32 gpio domain (in stm32 pinctrl 
driver), data and parent->data are then associated to it.

Sorry if it is not clear.
