Lexman,

I don't quite get the problem. This looks exactly the same as for
max77686. What is the difference? I don't see any need to change the
mfd_cell for current drivers...

Alexandre,

All of these devices have some of the blocks under separate I2C address.
It is still a MFD because for example interrupts are shared and governed
by parent.
