gio_to_irq is provided by the GPIOLIB_IRQCHIP core. So fortunately we don't
have to take care.

Sure, it's a SW workaround. However working on a solution not supporting
IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH I'd consider wasted energy (YMMV).
Waiting for a future irq framework extension most likely is no solution as we
need a solution before production of Amlogic Meson chips ends ..

I will come up with a new version of the patch set addressing (most of) the
review comments. Then we have a updated basis for further discussion.

Thanks for the review / remarks.
