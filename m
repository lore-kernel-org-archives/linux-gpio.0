Yes, you are right.

However, I'd like to see this documented in the DT spec, rather than
kernel Documentation/ as this is a core binding. Though that would
also imply first moving the GPIO bindings there. Perhaps just how this
works generically could be in the spec, but the GPIO specifics can
live with the rest of the GPIO bindings for now. This is intended to
extend to other bindings.

The code is definitely hard to follow and I've not come up with any
ways to make it easier to read. It's largely copied from the
interrupt-map version, but different enough that sharing isn't really
possible either.

For interrupts, it's documented in the DT spec. The best (only?)
explanation for how interrupt-map works is here[1] (used to be at
devicetree.org).
