Sorry for typos, will fix in next version.

Yes.

I try to explain what they are on Spreadtrum platform. One pin can output
3.0v or 1.8v, depending on the related domain pad driving selection, if
the related domain pad slect 3.0v, then the pin can output 3.0v.

"system control" is used to choose this function (like: UART0) for which
system, since we have several systems (AP/CP/CM4) on one SoC.

Sure, will remove these.

Since we have lots of different pin configuration to set, it will be hard to
use the standard pin config describing in binding files. But I will try to
remove the magic number and use the common pin config.

Sure. I will try o fix this. Thanks for your helpful comments.
