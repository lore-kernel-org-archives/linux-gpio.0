Please do not send html-encoded email, it will get dropped by all mailing

Can you explain what the hardware does here? Do you mean you have no way
to read the GPIO level from the GPIO controller for any pin that is
configured as an interrupt?

Can you route all GPIO pins to arbitrary upstream IRQ lines, or is this
hardwired in the GPIO block?
