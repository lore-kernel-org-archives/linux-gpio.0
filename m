That is true for the individual pins, but not the device names.
Devices are just names gpiochipN where N is the instance
number. Topological info on the device can be found in sysfs.

The discussion here pertaining to the new chardev is just about
the intuitiveness of the number N, whether it should be
"whatever" or something predictable.

For the purpose of picking a certain named GPIO line (see below)
knowing this number is unnecessary. To that mechanism all gpio
chips are equal and the instance number does not matter.

That works. It relies on the developers using sane naming conventions
though. (This problem is prevalent everywhere I guess, a human problem,
not a technical one.) I made this patch:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-arm-kernel&m=146672328215354&w=2

There is a standard document for these boards (96board) specifying
the names of the GPIO lines to be "GPIO-A" thru "GPIO-L".

So a user can iterate across the gpiochips (as is done in lsgpio)
and pick the lines with the right names.

This works fine, given you have such conventions or equal.

I.e. the person writing the DTS file naming the lines must not
be a complete lunatic.

I can think of scenarios where bad use can make things problematic:
i.e. name two lines the same thing, albeit on different GPIO chips.
That is currently allowed, and if that happens, the user must
use topological information about the gpiochip (from sysfs) to
uniquely identify the GPIO line.

I wouldn't recommend that since it is essentially inventing a
problem for oneself to solve, but I don't know what reasons
people may have to do something like that. There is no technical
problem with it.

I think so...
