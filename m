Semantics matter.

In the old board file code, the gpio_request()s were present to work
around the bug in the OMAP driver where request_irq() wouldn't configure
the IRQ signal correctly. That's the primary reason those calls were there.

Now, this had the side-effect of also preventing anything else from
calling gpio_request() on those GPIOs, but that wasn't the primary
motivation; just a convenient effect.

s/input/output/ I assume.

If all you want to do is prevent gpio_direction_input() on a GPIO that's
in use as a GPIO, then that's probably OK.

However, the interrupt consistency patch that was posted implemented
that restriction by calling gpio_request(), and the wording of most of
what you've written implies to me that implementing the restriction by
calling gpio_request() is what you're after. That approach imposes far
more restrictions than just preventing gpio_direction_input(). Imposing
those additional restrictions is what I'm objecting to.
