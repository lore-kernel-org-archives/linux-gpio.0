I understood your points. But we can not program all into the
registers at one early point, sometimes these sleep-related configs
need depend on some conditions in users' drivers, like on condition 1:
driver need to set one pin as input-enable when specified system goes
into deep sleep, on condition 2: driver need set this pin as
output-enable when specified system goes into deep sleep. So I still
think it is better if we introduce some standard sleep related
configs.
